# The Party

The Party

Something that stars out conspicuously enough. I think maybe a couple going to a party. There’s the anticipation. Then there’s basically a story about a party, brought to spiritual dimensions, where I get to go into my different ideas about how to deal with eternity in a situation. Perhaps there are lots of deep conversations that take place about the nature of reality, all the big stuff, spiritual questions. Maybe it doesn’t have to get so metaphysical where people are literally at this party forever. But maybe they are. Again, it depends on the kind of party. It should be specific. Even if it reaches certain metaphysical levels and it becomes about “The Party” as if its “The Truth” then I still think there’s a time where the party “ends” somehow, or rather, the party keeps going on but you choose to leave it.

 Who is my main character that needs to learn about “the party?” I actually think I want to go ahead and attempt drafting and just see what comes out. I think it’s a shy introvert type guy who’s never liked parties.

 What was I thinking of earlier related to my party idea? I was thinking about ones attitude towards the party, I was specifically thinking about my own seriousness in regard to life, the continual theme of dealing with it very seriously, of being on a mission, and knowing that the spiritual part of life will give that to me, because that’s my desire, not actually a reflection of some more true reality.

 I’m thinking about the different ways I could tell this story, part of me wants to tell it first person, other parts of me want to keep distance from it. I think part of me wants to start establishing a “God” voice, the 3rd person omniscient that is favoring one character’s perspective, because even if a character is self-loathing or struggling, it allows me to still look upon them kindly. So I think I just want to try and start drafting it. I think it has to be about a very shy, unhappy guy who doesn’t like parties, and has a whole bout of anxiety even going. It’s a combination, the more specific the better. It’s a party in which he expects not to know anyone, and doesn’t think he’ll meet anyone he can get along with. And, there’s other people there who he doesn’t want to see, people he’s dreading seeing. His partner is framing it for him in the nicest terms, because she is really excited to see all these people. All of this is framed in anxiety because the man is afraid this party represents all the things she wants that he doesnt have an can’t offer, and if they go to this party, she will meet someone who she really wants to be with, and he will be left with nothing. So there’s a whole big before part that frames this all up, him not wanting to go, what kind of party it’s supposed to be, some hint at part of what he’s afraid about, and then her giving the spiel about the future is a party you won’t know about unless you go and find out. The ride over, being filled with anxiety.

 Pretty immediately upon arriving, it has to go south for him, filled with all the things that he dreaded happening. His partner runs away, gets caught up in a conversation, he’s on his own and sees someone he doesn’t want to see, hates the conversation, and gets ready to leave immediately. But someone pulls him in. It has to be someone he thinks is like him, someone he can relate to, who can help guide him into the party.

 There has to be a check-in with the partner of some kind. But eventually, there’s an invitation to drugs that he says yes to. The drug itself is ambiguous. There needs to be:

--a serious conversation

--a large game, drinking game, song,

--a meeting with a new interesting person.

See, I don’t want it to become too fantastical of a party. It’d be best if it stayed in the realm of actual parties, an “average party” as long as it comes along that point of explaining the deeper meaning of “the party”

There’s a tightrope to walk here. The party can be exciting and interesting in ways that don’t have to be entirely fantastical. I feel like there’s a theme or realization of trying to keep track of the partner, and the fear coming true, where she does meet someone else, and you somehow already know this is where it begins, the breaking up and drifting apart, but it’s somehow not as bad, because you’ve went ahead and made some of your own new friends.

What im debating now is whether it’s better to keep this grounded, more like your average party, or to let it tear off into the sublime otherworld, which is obviously what interests me, but I think many people will be like “this is an unrealistic expectation to set for a party.” And i’d love to find a synthesis between these two points, where it does feel like real parties actually are, but it can also indulge in the more insane possibilities of the party space, even the dark ones. Someone should definitely die at this party, and it’s this absurd thing that’s taken in stride.

 Because what’s the theme after all, what’s my thesis?

 Life is a party. It is a party that never ends It’s a party most people forget they’re at, except when they get reminded. But it’s always a party. Always has been. After all, what is a party? A gathering, most people would say, but aren’t there sometimes parties of one? Then a party is really at bottom a kind of spirit. A party, even a party of one, is called so because there’s something being celebrated. Even if there are parties, there are parties for the sake of themselves, parties for the sake of celebration. It is the ultimate attitude of life, the ultimate synthesis of what Life means. A party is celebration itself. It can be an instrument of praise, but it can also be composed of destruction, death. Riots can feel like parties. War is that party. Funerals. Hospitals, mental institutions. There is only one Party. It is always going on, and it never ends. People only choose to leave and come back. But no one can end the party. All parties are part of the one party that’s always going on. Every terrible thign you’ve ever heard about is also involved in the party, even something like genocide, or holocaust, like it or not, that happened at the party once. SO did woodstock, and every peaceful festival, and every dancehall that allowed people to celebrate each other when they otherwise couldn’t.

 So what I’m trying to get across is an enlightenment in the course of a night. But again, wanting this to be a real person, not just some everyman sent through a spiritual transformation, where does Clay end up at the end of all this, of a night that changed everything? At the end of it, he knows his partner met someone who she’s eventually going to leave him for. Though he’s lost her, he’s gained this whole new relationship to life, which before he treated as a mission. What was his stance, if it was in any way similar to mine? He was probably the kind of writer who felt as if he had many deep feelings and emotions and was precious about his own suffering, so maybe he’s a kindof introverted songwriter, Elliot Smith type, but nowhere near as good or deep, someone who just learned to fetishize their own depression, then why is this chick with him in the first place? Well, if he’s like me, he’s a very serious and sincere person, but someone probably not entirely jaded, wet behind the ears. Think about how this whole discovery with parties happened for me in college. It was like a discovery. Obviously parties were things in high school but not very much in my circle. Then in New Paltz, the world opened up to me like a magnificent flower.

Alright well I think at some point soon I will get up early and try a draft on this and just see what happens. I have an idea in mind, but not a super strong one, so it should be fun to just see how Clay’s journey plays out.

4/12/21

This is a story about a young, pessimistic musician named Clay, his partner Katrina, and they’re going to a party together. He doesn’t really want to go, and the first part of the story is them on the way over, this kindof sullen dynamic where she is always catering to his sensitive, fearful feelings, and he’s really only going because he’s afraid he’ll lose her if he doesn’t. So he’s in a very fearful place, and they’re having this discussion about how to regard parties, and she’s expressing her point of view.

 They arrive at the party, and pretty instantly, Clay is in a bad way about it. We immediately address all the ways in which we hate the party. But then we meet a stranger, an Ain’t Shit, who’s able to open Clay up by describing the true reality of the Party. From there, it’s a drinking game that loosens Clay up. Then, there’s a sing along, and he gets to play his guitar. Then, there’s an invitation to go do some drugs discretely. He has to fall into it because he’s seen Katrina talking to the person he was afraid she would, so there’s a sense of him having already lost her, and them going forward.

 But there’s a part of me that also sees it somehow wrapping up in this very calm way, as if it was just a pretty tame evening, and then they drive home together. I think I just have to go for it, and find out what happens.

 I found myself hitting a wall once i got to the party, making stuff up in an uninspired way. I’d like to get past that self-judgement, and make something even if i feel terrible about it in the moment of making it. Which is an incentive to go ahead and try finishing it tonight or today. The other idea is to sit and word vomit for a while here and see if I can craft a narrative with each beat fitting perfectly. I really should try it both ways, as two separate iterations. The first one should then be completely improvisational, leaning in fully to the blind discovery of it, removing all censors and self0judgement, writing truly as a form of being. So maybe i’ll tag back into that later tonight.

  
4/13/21 -- I got in a good morning pages where I got to clarify to myself what i’m going for. Looking back through my draft, i can tell I want to approach it with a different style, just something more deliberate and precise, something that doesn’t mince words. Closer to what I achieved with the Gift Shop. The few points that remain in my head:

--3rd person omniscient, favoring Clay’s perspective. Maintain the prelude of their dynamic arriving to the party.

--I’m now imagining a rooftop party. An apartment down below, but a party that’s a little “younger” than I initially imagined, as opposed to the slightly more adult one I imagined, a small gathering that feels formal. I think this needs to be big and expansive enough to allow a few possibilities.

--Still maintain the initial dread upon arrival, all the ‘terrible’ things about a party that have more to do with someone’s own internal perspective than with the party itself. More of a him being off to himself, probably leaning into that whole “guy leaning against a wall sipping beer and thinking too much” thing.

--But then he has to meet someone who engages him. But the conversation has to guide him naturally into a whole slew of activities. There’s obviously a going to the bathroom part that has to be vulnerable, like getting a peak at something that you shouldn’t.

--there’s gotta be a sobriety bit, or rather a lack of it, something that causes someone who doesn’t normally indulge to go for it. But I also don’t want it to be all about the drugs. Alcohol is enough for most people. Maybe there’s some weed at some point, some coke.

--Does Clay get ‘fucked up’? If he does, it should be something that Kat enjoys seeing. She herself must be totally going wild.

--but clay gets a big, spiritual, poetic take-away from the evening, he has to learn about The Party, and now see EVERYTHING through this new light, once it dawns on him. Let’s not make it too much about the drugs and inebration for him. He has to be lucid enough to see what’s going on and then maybe take Kat home at the end of the night.

--I think he should meet someone else, beyond the platonic friend.

Let’s also stop turning people into ideas. Who is this person? Perhaps it oculd be more like one conversation carried on between many different people, Almost as if the party itself is speaking through people. So it’s as if the spirit of the party itself is the one letting him know what’s up.

-- Assuming this is someone in his later 20’s, like me, living a similar life, who’s probably been to many parties before, why is it now that this grand revelation comes over him? It’d be easier to make sense of if this was me as a young kid, freshman in college who’s new to partying in general.

 But with a proper style it may not be such an issue. It’s important o stay in tune with, who is this person people are supposed to sympathize with? It’s me obviously. What am I sharing? A way to understand parties in a cosmic manner. In a way that for me, made something that was always overwhelming and anxious when I was younger and turned it into a source of joy. And understanding it doesn’t change the fact that sometimes I’m not feeling it and would prefer to be alone, that’s still true. So it’s just someone who doesn’t like parties, but sometimes you’ve gotta go to parties. That happens to people of all ages, just having to go somewhere you don’t wanna go. In this case, I set up that he has to go because it’s his partner’s friend’s party, and he’s afraid if he doesn’t go he’s going to lose her, because she is the center of his sense of connection. He probably doesn’t have a lot of other connections. So this party just happens to have the magical cocktail that opens up his sense of connection, to the point where at the end of the night, and things wind down, not only does he feel fulfilled, but he feels like he’s more open to the world. It’s a night that changes his life, because he did make and meet friends. Him and Kat will probably split and it’ll be for the best. But, he walked through a door, and hasn’t looked back to where he came from, and probably never will.

So again, I think I might just want to move to drafting this on computer on thursday, maybe working from the outline, figuring out the different chunks and how they fit and sequence together, and then building it out in that way. It’s becoming clearer, the more time I spend working with it, as is the case with anything else I work on.

5/12/21

Been a while since I worked on this story, and it is one I feel to have a lot of potential, and I just want to go for it the way I have with other stories that haven’t turned out terrible on a first past.

It’s a story that’s very small and grounded at first. Guy going to a party with his partner, hates parties, maybe has a general sense of malaise, a state I know well, because keep in mind who is the person who needs to hear or receive this idea of the Party. Probably someone who is too serious, someone who takes the whole business of life too seriously. Probably a philosopher, the part of me that has taken life too seriously in the past, someone who has trouble letting go and having fun. Someone who has trouble receiving the fun, looks at it all as stupid.

And the party starts timid, get all the terrible boring parts out of the way, but ease slowly into the larger picture.

One question that remains is whether this should all stay in a grounded reality, and let it just be a profound conversation that opens it up, or whether it should bend reality a bit to actualize the ideas, because it’s really a party you haven’t arrived at yet until something inside says yes, and then the party goes on forever, and you come and go to the party as you please

\*\*what is it we’re celebrating? In any party, there’s an excuse, but really it’s celebration itself. It’s the ultimate spiritual state, the tip of the pyramid, and you’re always there, even in the darkest aspects of humanity, the war and famine, the whole thing. So I think it should go on the whole journey and find it’s way back to the rooftop, the shirt band and the people too sick, and finally taking the cab ride home with the partner and the sense of living in a different world. Tomorrow Thursday this is the focus.

 5/13/21

 Jeremy was one of many in this world who didn’t like parties and was self-conscious about it--self conscious about not liking parties. Of course, parties themselves were the kind of events some magnified his self-consciousness somehow.

 It didn’t matter how many times memes and posts online had insisted to him that he was in good company with many other people who felt the same, all the jokes made \(online, in a safe space where one could take time to articulate things\) to show parties for what they were, all the different attempts to brush it off as an unnecessary, unimportant aspect of life, something really boring compared to the intimate one on ones, or anything else. Or all the general pitch son mental health and wellness, -destigmatization-- everyone was trying to hard to make it seem like parties didn’t matter, but it seemed possible to deny that parties were important.

 Everyone could think of a party from childhood that meant a lot to them, whether it was a totally sunny memory, or maybe there was some unusual about it, maybe dark, maybe bizarre or uncanny, something more like poetry, where the event says something more than any word can contain.

 But even then, early on, Jeremy remembered the exhaustion, the crabbiness, when an all-day birthday party turned into a sleepover that he couldn’t han gin for, because he was too overwhelmed. All the times, in a house full of his friends and others, when he just wanted it to be quiet and be alone.

 And it happened over and over again, even as he entered college and made friends, and went to parties and had okay times, there was almost always an anxiety attack before the party got started, and the only way through it was getting fucked up so he didn’t care anymore. It felt horrible every time, but the reward he got form that was his friends thinking he was normal.

 Because everyone else he knew loved parties, and someone who didn’t like parties--there was something wrong with them. Jer couldn’t tell why this was the case, but he knew it. Parties, if properly understood, were this inherent good, one it seemed most people grabbed instinctively. Yet, there was not a party announced among his friends that he did not dread, because no matter what he did, he suffered: Either he stayed home, enjoyed his solace, and spent the whole time thinking not only about all the things he was missing, but knowing it was only his own fault that he was missing out, or, he went, and spent the whole time crippled with anxiety until he got drunk enough to stop caring, and nothing significant would happen that he remembered, and he’d wake up in the morning feeling like shit, knowing he hadn’t missed anything remarkable or important, and he came to these events only so that his friends would know he was normal, and not some anti-social freak.

 Because that’s what everyone thought, no matter what they said to Jer’s face. That’s what anyone thinks about someone who doesn’t like parties, who avoids them or doesnt go.

 So there he was, with his partner Bea, getting ready to go to a party of her friends and co-workers-- his friend’s too, no doubt, people he could talk to with some level of comfort-- but a party nonetheless. Getting ready, he was quiet, mainly glued to his phone, scrolling in order to attempt to be mindless, to get through another thing which he had to get through for the sake of someone he cared for and didn’t want to lose.

 When they got on the subway, he started asking questions like, who’s going to be there? What kind of party was it going to be? If it was small enough, then it put more pressure on him to perform in some kindof way- one of those terrible, small gatherings where the host would coordinate conversations, and games to play that always felt to him like a performance or a put - on. A dinner table where lulls of silence signaled some kindof failure on one or all of their parts, the mad attempt to fill it up with any small comment, which lead to people fishing for things to talk about, taking greaters risks to say something that might make things worse-- what about that was fun or relaxing?

 Or alternatively, it’d be free-wheeling, filled with masses of strangers and so much noise you could barely actually get to know anyone. In those cases it was easier to blend into the wall and pretend like you didn’t exist, but as well, there was this dance that took place of people moving in and out of conversations, saying hello, getting dragged in and waiting for the time for the conversation to peter out, or to go to the bathroom, and spend the rest of the night avoiding someone. Or else it was floating around, not knowing how to engage, feeling totally adrift, with no one to guide you along. And all too much.

 There was no happy medium between these two situations, either. You could never strike the perfect balance between having no presence or too much presence. In any gathering that could be called a party, Jer always wanted nothing more than to be alone.

 This time, while riding the train, and he tried to anticipate what it would be like, so that he could prepare, not in anyway that would help him, just so that he wound’t have to deal with surprise as much as possible-- while he interrogated Bea, she brought up this idea that helped her deal with these environments: THe future itself was like a party you hadn’t yet arrived at, and while you could imagine al the hypotheticals about how it might be, the only way to find out, one way or ther other, was by going and finding out.

 The future remained always in a state of pure hypothetical, a safe place to manipulate in one’s head, and it was unavoidable that it would come. Parties were perfectly avoidable, but again, not without consequence.

Bea liked Jer because he was a musician. He sang beautifully and strummed a guitar, and she did all of the work of getting to know him, and he got to feel loved without having to make a show of himself. In turn, he got to fall in love with someone, and now would do anything to hold onto that one connection in his life that felt natural and unforced.

As time had gone on and they’d moved in together, for a while his brooding was cute, but he soon saw that he couldn’t go on living in his own bubble without bearing through the things she asked of him. And the struggles between them came when it was about more than just bearing through it—she wanted him to _enjoy_ it, not just for her sake, because then it was still a labor she ended up being responsible for.

This issue had been simmering between the for weeks now, unspoken as they were about to arrive at this new party, but implicit that he would be asked to really try to enjoy himself, no matter how much trying to enjoy something was a paradox.

When they arrived, they were greeted by the host, Bea’s work friend Kenny, and there was already an apartment full of people. Some of them dropped their conversation to warmly greet their beloved friend, others carried on. People that knew Jer gave him warm smiles and hugs, and then went about their business. Bea had given up on guiding him through every phase of the night, had insisted that he’d never find a way to enjoy it if he was clinging to her the whole time, never stepping out for himself.

He introduced himself to someone who also looked quiet and lonely, and unfortunately they found themselves looking in a mirror where neither one seemed to feel they could really get into anything with each other, which left the gentlemen walking away slowly once their five minutes of small talk had fallen apart.

The party had a rooftop where there was a bad indie rock band playing, a big, open rooftop where someone like Jer could find an empty corner, smoke a cigarette and look out over the city because that was the most agreeable way to exist he could imagine in this scenario.

Really hard to get the ball rolling on this, especially when the concept or moral feels a little vague at this point. My goal here is to tell a story that raises the party to a metaphysical level.

“You don’t like parties, I can tell. Let me ask you then, what does it mean to celebrate? It means to participate in a collective joy. That celebration has infinite forms and reasons: it’s when someone is born, or when they die. It’s for when they graduate, when they accomplish something. It’s also for when they fail and they drown their arrows with a bunch of other miserable of fucks. It’s for revolutions, the ones that work and the ones that don’t. Then there’s parties just to party, and what are they celebrating? Celebration itself!

There’s only one party, really, one celebration. And it never ends. It dies down, the vine travels and some places it has a lull. But every moment of every life, at every point in history, it’s all the same party!”

“Bull shit. You’re saying war and famine and poverty are also parties? You’re sayin log the Holocaust was a party?”

“Problem is, you’re still thinking The Party looks a certain way, you’re trying to say that one part of it tells you the whole story. I’m talking about reality. The Rwandan genocide was a trip where people celebrated power and bloodlust and glory and victory.”

“And everyone tortured and raped and murdered was also partying?”

“Yes.”

“I can’t see that.”

“How does all the horror fit into the party?”

“It just does. The Party doesn’t always look like peace love and understanding. It looks like the Vietnam war, and the Iraqi war, and every genocide you can think of. And don’t think no ones having fun when that’s happening. Young men treat it like a video game. Old men treat it like gambling in Vegas. It’s all an entertainment, a celebration. And for people that survive camps and torture and imprisonment and war, they’re getting through it in the same way they’re getting out of it. They’re celebrating! They’re playing games and jokes and singing songs. You ever hear about the Christmas battle innWW1, all the different troops fighting each other all get together and celebrate their common tradition?

The party never ends.

Even in the post apocalyptic waste, on the dead planet, the party gets cosmic.

The Party is the pinnacle, the final frontier, it’s Valhalla, but we’re already there in Valhalla!

So I can’t leave the party?

Nonsense, of course you can, everyone can come and go as they please but it’s not a physical thing, it’s an inner thing. The party is within you.

You’re not at the party yet.

What do you mean? I’m at the party.

No. The party is here, it’s happening, but you haven’t arrived yet.

So, if the party is always going on, but I can come and go as I please, what’s outside of the party?

Whatever you want to believe, that’s up to you. If you ask me, though, once you arrive to the party you never really leave. Even when you’re sick and dying, I don’t think you’re really raving the party.

1. preamble to the party: Jer and Bea, setting up the characters and their issues
2. Arriving to the party: tame state, the slow ramping up from an awkward small gathering, the cast becomes bigger and bigger
3. Lost in the maze: a full blown banger with so much going on, and the introduction: “you haven’t arrived at the party yet.
4. Getting surreal: going through the scenes: trace the thread from the Big Bang
5. Primates and primitive pagans, Romans, conquerors and people throughout history celebrating, endlessly and continuously, the whole scope of a life filled with trial and suffering, plagues, famines.
6. The modern world, celebrating itself, even as the lonely dive bar drunkards, the festivals, and clubs, even the rape and intimidation: the serious labors of work, great geniuses and scholars and scientists and statesmen, all through their work, celebrating.
7. Even in the camps, in the worst conditions, in the most depraved forms of suffering, celebrating!
8. The whole lives lived, beginning at a chance encounter at a party.
9. The sun rising as you and some new friends soak in the gory of another sunset, washed out and hung over, and it’s time to go back to that party which is winding down.
10. And you take your partner home in the taxi, finally at home in the Party. And you might forget about the Party one day, but it’ll find you again.

I picture Jer surrealistically living through all these great rooms of the party, where doors open endlessly into further and further corridors. For example, how does Jer get wrapped up enough to go on the beginning of the adventure? Because I don’t want it to be one character laying it all out for the other. If anything he should be a wise fool idiot savant, a simpleton but a Guru who knows the party. And Jer is in this place where he’s obviously been to many parties but he’s never “arrived” to the party. And he’s here for his partner who he clings to, and fears he’s losing and he feels alone in the world. And this whole trip amounts to him letting go because he goes through so many transformations over the course of the night.

5/12/21

 I’m going to sit here and write about the party and get my head into it, build a story in the way I know it’s lingering in my head.

 Part 1\) What’s important to establish here, right off the bat? The couple, their dynamic, Ezra. I’m gonna call him Ezra now. And his relationship to parties in general. The realistic set-up that lets an audience buy this guy going to party he doesn’t want to go to, and set up his general disdain of parties. I”m pulling from my own sense of what I’ve disliked about parties in the past, and simply what’s it’s like to a be a person caught up in never really arriving to the party.

1. I want to say how the city is alive, how it thrumming, filled with people engaging together, talking, having fun, and particularly with the focus on people all getting ready to go a party, people getting dressed, winding up by taking a drink before they go, just a scene or a paragraph on the city preparing for a large night
2. Zoom in to the apartment of Ezra and Beatrice, and the difference in atmosphere. Bea is playing music, putting on lipstick and drinking wine. Ezra is locked in his head, or occasionally asking who’s going to be there, a conversation where he’s trying to anticipate the night before it happens. Then conversation continued in a cab ride over the apartment. We learn about their relationship, the fear that Ezra has over losing her, the possessiveness, the sense of discontent and inadequacy that obviously drives her crazy, even if she loves him, ending with the parable on the future.
3. Arriving at the gathering which is still small, going through all the torturous formalities, the attempts to curate a good time, a few more people showing up, getting caught up ins ome conversation, before you know it, the party has become much larger, filled with people, music blasting.
4. Time to step outside for some air on the rooftop with the band playing. Talking to a stranger who first says, “You’re not at the party yet, you haven’t arrived.”
5. What different scenes do I want to take this to? I think dive bar of sad drunkards makes sense, club vibe, but I also picture the people who end up wandering the streets and getting into shenanigans, even funerals, birthdays, College graduations, revolutions, sporting events,

 ---------------------

 The City is getting ready for tonight, because it’s Saturday. After a hard winter, the air is finally warm, even long after sunset, and the people have finished shedding their old coats. Music for dancing echoes in the gorges of the avenues, food simmers on grills, and everyone goes about their rituals of preparation.

 In one apartment, Beatrice plays an 80’s R&B playlist and paints her face with colors while sipping pino. Her partner, Ezra, is slumped on her couch in the jeans and flannel he wears everyday, scrolling on his phone, looking at nothing.

 “Who’s going to be there?” He asks Beatrice.

 “I don’t know,” She replies, “People from work, probably some other people.”

 “Is it going to be a big party?” He asks more precisely.

 “I don’t know.” She replies, sipping her wine and reapplying her lipstick. She turns from her vanity and poses for him, but he’s looking at his phone.

He looks up, and says, “You look beautiful.”

“Thank you.”

Beatrice grabs the unopened bottle of wine from the counter.

“How far away is the car?” She asks.

“Two minutes.”

“Let’s head down then.”

Beatrice says goodbye to her cat, Milo, and locks the door behind them.

Out on the street, Beatrice asks Ezra, “How are you feeling?”

“Fine,” he says.

The car arrives, and they get in. It’s a twenty minute drive. Ezra cradles the bottle of wine between his legs. The driver is playing reggaeton. Outside the windows, some people are walking somewhere, others are already where they’re going to be all night.

“How late do you think it’ll go?” Ezra asks.

“I don’t know,” she whispers.

“I don’t want to stay too late,” he says.

“Then don’t.” They look at each other, then look back out their windows. She leans over to the driver and asks him to turn up the music. Reggaeton fills the silence. Beatrice turns back to Ezra, grabs his hand.

“You know, trying to think about the future is just like trying to think about a party that’s about to happen. You can try to anticipate it all you want, whether it’ll be a good time or a bad time. But the only way to find out is to show up and find out.”

“True,” He admits, and squeezes her hand. To himself, he thinks, _What if the problem isn’t the party, but me?_

The car stops in front of the building. They get out, and Beatrice buzzes 3A. The door opens, and they walk up the stairs, and can just hear the murmurs beyond the door, just a few voices.

Gracie opens the door, squealing, and embraces Beatrice, then Ezra. Beatrice offers the wine, and Gracie guides them into the living room, where Janet, Eloise, Hector, Jameel, and Connie are sitting. Everyone gets up and hugs and asks how they’re doing. Ezra is meeting half of them for the first time. There’s only one conversation going on, Beatrice, Gracie, and Hector are the ones that work together, and are recounting the crazy thing that happened.

In a lull, Gracie takes drink orders, and tells them about the band that’s going to be playing on the rooftop later, and one of her other friends will be DJing after. Hector, Eloise, and Jameel get into a conversation about the corrupt government and the backwards people who don’t see the obvious things they see. Gracie, Beatrice, and Hector are gossiping about the other coworkers who weren’t invited. Ezra is half-listening.

The buzzer sounds, so Gracie excuses herself to get the door, and Hector asks Ezra about his life, what he’s been up to. Ezra tells him about his job, which isn’t interesting, and admits he wants to transition into another line of work, maybe go back to school. Hectors agrees that’s all very interesting, and when he asks further what Ezra thinks he wants to do, Ezra admits he doesn’t know and is trying to figure it out. Hector smiles and says, “Hey, who isn’t?”

Ezra feels like no one is trying to figure _it_ out. Because when people say _It_, in this ambiguous sense, most often they’re referring to life itself, and most people he’s ever talked to don’t seem to be able to really talk about it, like they gave up at some point, or never _really_ thought about what it means to figure _It_ out. He says none of this, doesn’t even think it then, because the sense of this problem is the invisible air he breathes.

A new cohort of people have arrived, and a few more behind them. The room is filled with people talking, which makes it easier to move unnoticed. Ezra finds the bathroom, relieves himself, comes back to find the living room and dining room almost full. He pulls a can of beer from a 30 rack someone has donated. He sees Beatrice talking to Dana, who he doesn’t like. He won’t dare try to walk in on the conversation.

People with musical gear are talking to Gracie, and she guides them up the stairs to the rooftop, where they are loading their gear.

Everything is happening around Ezra, and he speaks to no one. By now, at least 25 people are on the large rooftop overlooking the neighborhood. The view of the city skyline is very nice. Ezra pulls out a cigarette, and stands in the corner to observe everything from a distance, and let his thoughts come and go in peace.

A man about his age witha buzzed head, a tiedie shirt and jean shorts walks over to him and asks to bum a cigarette, and Ezra obliges. The guy has big lips, and smiles a lot. After taking a drag, he says to Ezra, “So, when are you gonna come to the party?”

“You mean, the one we’re at now?” Ezra asks.

“Yeah.”

“I’m here.”

“No,” The guy shakes his head, smiling through his big lips and the cigarette hanging from his mouth. “You’re not at the party. You’re at the party, sure, but you haven’t _arrived_ yet, know what I mean?”

Ezra knows hippies and the strange ways they speak, but he has an idea what this guy means. “I’m not a big fan of parties.”

“That’s ‘cause you’ve never actually arrived to the party.”

“I don’t get what you mean.”

The guy is still smiling, dragging his bogarted bustdowns. Ezra is interested, because this guy is talking about _It_ like he knows something Ezra doesn’t, and Ezra has always wanted to know.

“I’m Ain’t Shit,” the man offers his hand, and Ezra shakes it.

“Ain’t Shit?”

“That’s my name.”

“I’m Ezra.”

“Nice to meet you Ezra. I’ll see you at the party.” Ain’t Shit walks away, over to some other people who are dressed similar to him. The band has started playing. Ezra is churning over what Ain’t Shit said.

Ezra has never enjoyed a party in his life. It wasn’t that he was socially awkward either, or didn’t know how to talk to people, or didn’t enjoy things. He did, but if he was being honest, those simple feelings felt further and further away with each year. He followed Ain’t Shit over to his circle of friends and introduced himself.

Ain’t Shit and his crew were smoking a joint, and offered it to Ezra but he turned it down. His heart was already in his chest, and he wasn’t trying to panic anymore, but for some reason, he felt like he could talk to this guy and say what he really felt.

“I’m afraid I’m going to lose my partner. Because I can’t find this joy that seemingly everyone else has. If I lose her, then I’ll be alone. Tonight, I feel like I’m going to lose her. I don’t know what to do.”

“I know what you need to do, man.” Ain’t Shit presents Ezra with a red solo cup that smells like chemicals. Ezra hesitates for a moment, but anything to get the lump out of his heart. It tastes like fire and blood and ice cream and God and the Devil.

 Across the skyline, fireworks are exploding, doubled in the river. The rooftop is filled with awe and wonder and hoots and hollers and bad covers of radio pop. Ezra is the firework, which is also the Big Bang. In that explosion, little specks of light pull gravitational forces around them and form solar systems, and delicate balances create other smaller explosions of elements that form materials and elements and water and cells and organisms. There’s lots of killing and eating and fucking and dying for a time, but then one of the neanderthalls eats a fun guy, and becomes a fungi. Before, they were all killing and eating and fucking and dying, but now they’re killing and eating and fucking and dying-- and singing and dancing and playing.

Ezra is a Roman during Saturnalia, and his commander is commending his heroism. The spoils he managed to keep safe from his legion were sold on the market, and will pay for his own son to receive lessons so he might read and avoid the battlefield. He drinks wine and fucks his wife. The child they have from that night will become Constantine, and christianize the empire.

Ezra is a Medieval Goliard, a frustrated student of clergy who’s wasted all his parents money to go to university, only to find out that you only receive power in the clergy if they like you and that the Catholic church holds less salvation than this pub, with its common people and their funny, bawdy songs. He writes rhymes to sing, taking shit after shit on the church’s hypocrisy, and people love him. Only here does he feel free, singing and fucking and gambling the clothes off his back, drafting a letter requesting more money with a headache in the morning.

Ain’t Shit taps Ezra on the shoulder, and the vibrant embers of the firework are reflected in his eyes. “Welcome to The Party, man.”

Ezra and Ain’t Shit are ripping a joint, dancing to the DJ. Ain’t Shits friends pull them into a game of beer pong, and Ezra surprises himself with how well he does. Next is a game of cornhole, which he sucks at for some reason, but couldn’t care less. Ezra meets people who he bears his soul to, and they in turn, and then he never sees them again. Ezra sees Beatrice dancing with Dana, kissing. Ezra drinks and smokes more, and requests of his new crew that they do something crazy.

“Fuck this place, let’s take a walk.” Ain’t Shit, Ezra, and their three other grimy hippie friends push through the apartment with DJ and clublights in full effect, and make their way out onto the street, and only need to walk a block before finding the main drag of the city.

“Fuck that party, man,” Ezra is saying, but Ain’t Shit stops him as if he was about to step in shit.

“But the party’s still going on.”

“Yeah, but we left.”

“Nah, we’re still at the party.”

They walk the street, and meet some other people on their way to a bar. They’re an older crew, people Ezra would never talk to before he arrived to the Party. They walk into a club with deep house music, and cages with gogo dancers. No one has money, except Ezra, and he leaves his card open with the bar. They dance, and they meet more people. They step outside to smoke, and watch a fight go down. One of the people fighting pulls out a gun, and shoots a friend of Ain’t Shit’s, now Ezra friend, but he can’t remember the girl’s name.

They bring the body to the hospital, get a time of death declared, speak to police, and the next day, they’re at a funeral home, filled with people that were friends and family. People are sad, moaning, crying, falling to the ground, and people are rushing to pick them up. As things wind down, Ain’t Shit, Ezra and friends go down the block to a bar, filled with sad old men. They talk about poetry, and regrets, and misery. Then Ain’t Shit raises a toast, and everyone at the bar toasts the memory of Lizzie: “To Lizzie.” It’s watered down Whiskey, but it tastes good.

“We should’ve stayed at the party,” Ezra murmurs.

Ain’t Shit says, “We’re still there.”

Loaded from the bar, they walk out onto the streets and find riots going on. Mobs are hanging politicians and billionaires in the streets. Everything is free to grab. Ezra and Ain’t Shit make some more friends, and live in the streets with many others for two or three weeks. Then the tanks come in, and people are gassed into hiding. There’s martial law for a bit, then the new dictatorship issues mandatory labor. People sing songs while they break up rocks on a chain gang.

Ezra and Ain’t Shit form a relationship with a guard, and one day, while they’re sleeping with chains around their ankles on the street, the guard comes and releases them in whispers, releases everyone, and they all fist bump. The prisoners grab weapons, and murder soldiers in their sleep. Another revolution happens, and people drink themselves dizzy in the street.

The sun is rising. Ezra, Ain’t Shit, and the gang are sitting on the bank of the river, drinking, smoking, talking bullshit. Ezra muses,

“So, there’s only One Party?”

“Yeah,” Ain’t Shit says.

“And it never ends?”

“Nope.”

Ezra scratches his chin.

“Can I leave?”

Ain’t Shit shrugs.

“Yeah, sure, whenever you want to, that’s up to you. Come and go as you please.”

Ezra nods.

“All of it is just a celebration.”

“Yeah man.”

“Even the death, the war, the horrible shit, the apocalypse. It’s everything, always, forever, and all time.”

Ain’t Shit makes a raspberry noise, and the whole crew cackles, even Ezra.

Ezra checks his watch. “I’m ready to go. I gotta find Beatrice.”

“Come back anytime.” Ezra waves at his friends, and walks back to the apartment where the party is happening.

Many people are asleep all over the place. Gracie is cleaning up while holding an ice pack to her head, and Ezra gives her a kiss. He finds Beatrice cuddled in a blanket, wakes her, and tells her he’s got a car waiting outside. Ezra gathers their things, says goodbye, and guides Beatrice sleepily into the car.

Good first attempt, lots to clean up. I think I know what’s possible with this story. It’s going to be a fine line to tow between it being grandiose and surreal, but we really want to meditate on humanity, which means we need to keep the details that make people care about all the people they’re reading about, but not in a forced way, either. I know what’s called for in my head, and it’s good to articulate it here in a loose way. It’s what Vonnegut does to some extent, by being grandiose, and at the same time very intouch with the hear to fhumanity.

To make the grad connections I want to make, in a way that’s not too heavy handed or on the nose.

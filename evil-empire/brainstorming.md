# Brainstorming

3/16/21 -- wanting to take this old idea of all ideas and fictional characters being these free agents, as somehow alive as living breathing people, and treating them as fodder.

--telling stories that take beloved fictional characters and raise their being into new dimensions.

--raising fan fiction into a new art form. Which is already happening to a large extent, where old cartoon characters are getting repurposed to symbolize new dimensions of current people’s experiences.

1. Disney Princesses & Queer liberation
2. All the disney character’s liberation from the Disney Empire, in collaboration with Indigenous artists and hackers, to rise up and overthrow the IP empire.
3. A story about the freedom of fictional characters, fictional characters becoming real.
4. Taking fictional characters that exist in other contexts, established universes and lore, and liberating them through subversion, making their understand and unveil their own context.

MOST MAJOR IP’s:

--Marvel

--Star Wars

--Lord of the RIngs

--Harry POtter

--nintendo

--pokemon

Winnie the pooh

Loonie toones

spongebob

Dragon ball

Simpsons

Family guy

Rick and morty

This is really going to be, at least the first story in what might be a larger one, is the beginning of the rebellion against Disney, taken on by the Princesses who are now waging a war across the Magic Kingdom. I still remember most of what I set up in the first draft attempt, which I can refine and rework. But I think the initial premise of some new princess benign workshopped, about to be erased and destroyed, when she’s saved by a coalition of the other princesses, and then they tell the new princess their stories, of how they woke up and became free. It should mirror real life in the sense that it’s not as if one person came in and red-pilled them, more than these things had been sitting there for a long time, and an opportunity presented itself, stars aligned, and the princesses own motivations were in line with it. And they will lay out the groundwork for the overthrow of the intellectual empire.

So, I want to do something like what I was doing, in terms of that first story attempt with the prototype new Disney Princess that’s about to get canned but then gets rescued by the other princesses and they take her to the hidden place in the realm of imagination, and they talk about winning their freedom and the beginning of the revolution to overthrow the mouse. Part of me just wants to find and transcribe that story for reference, for good stuff that’s in it. I think it’s in one of my journals, I’ll take a look for it.

What else do I want to keep in mind? I am thinking of this as one installment and there being several stories as a part of this canon. I think the real-world based IP story is still important.

—the story is the created princess who’s supposed to be Gay but then gets canned—or maybe they were trans? I think it makes more sense that they were trans, and facing the Princess robots.

--Found my recovered draft from probably 2018, late /early 2019, that I think serves as good initial inspiration, represented here:

 Connor the cock did his doodl do to signal the first rays of a new sun rising over the beautiful lands of Camelot. In tandem, the echo of the rooster and the suns rayed greeted the sense of young prince Ronald. He stretched up his arms and rose form bed, looking out his window with gratitude for another beautiful morning. Not a moment later, his faithful shaggy pup Mop burst into the room, jumped the bed and lapped him with wet kisses, and you prince giggled. Rightin after him was his father, King Arthur. By some magic, he was already fully suited in shiny metal, Excaliburhanging form his side:

 “Still laying about, Prince William? Come come, now! You have a kingdom you must learn to rule!” Prince William pouted playfully.

 “If I’m to rule the kingdom, then can’t I do as I wish? I only want to play with Mop for a while!” Mop scrambled over from the bed to receive pets from the King, still grinning playfully. “Oh, mop can join us for kingly duties.” King Arthur gestured over the whole kingdom outside William’s window.

 “We’re responsible for the safety and prosperity of everything the light touches, and it is only ours to rule by this sword, because it is ours to save and protect with.” Father and Son reveled in the sight of their land for a moment before King Arthur threw a wooden sword at Prince WIlliam and said, “Dress yourself, and I’ll see you downstairs.”

 “Yes, father.” William hopped form hisd bed and rubbed mop around the ears. “Today is going to change everything, Mop. Today, I’ll become what I was always meant to be.” King Arthur poked his head in WIlliam’s bedroom one more time.

 “And remember, no funny schemes! I was a boy to once, remember.”

 “None, father, for I’m not a boy after today!” Arthur smiled and left. And with enough time allowed him to get dressed, WIlliam broke out into a song with Mop:

 _It’s a new day, it’s a new me_

_Today I’ll become who I’m supposed to be!_

_No more rules only meant for boys_

_I’ll start wearing jewels, stop playing with toys_

_It’s a brand new day_

_Now I’ll go my own way!_

 King Arthur somehow picked up the same tune in the air and continued the next verse:

 _It’s a brand new day, brought by a new sun_

_And i”m so proud his time has come_

_He’s growing more brave he’s growing more strong_

_I knew he’d be just like me all along_

_He’ll make me proud today,_

_I can’t wait to hear him say…_

 “...I’m gay!” Arthur was pulled from the reverie of his verse by his son’s voice. He turned to see a maiden, dressed in rather fabulous finery, similar to the queen’s wardrobe, but far more fitting to this fair young woman. But he’d heard his son’s voice, but he saw now no William there. Arthur stared dumbfounded at the blushing Maiden curtsying before him. Then he recognized her:

 “Ah! Fair, Marion, the one I’ve been creeping through my woods when I walk at night. I hav elong dreamed of seeing more of you, here within my own walls, thought it does harm to my honor--

 “Father,” Marion responded, “Marion is your child.” Arthur gasped and grabbed his chest--

 “Holy Lord Jesus! The with Morgan Le Fey only told me of one bastard offspring, not of a second stain upon my name, perfectly smart of her--

 “Father!” Marion replied again. “I am you only child through holy matrimony to your queen.”

 Arthur peered long into the face of this strange nymph. The creature removed its hair, and King Arthur turned white. “Whilliam, what mischief is this? Of all days--

 “No, father, it is no mischief. Of all dyas, this is most important, for I could no longer wait.”

 “Today, you are to stop benign a boy, take up knighthood at the round table-- and become a man.”

 “Today I do stop benign a boy,” Marion replied, with head held high. “But I never wanted to be a man, either. What I’ve always wanted to be, what I’ve always felt I truly am, is a princess.” Marion pulled her hair back on and declared for all time: “Princess Marion.” She was radiantly beautiful, but Arthur could no longer see straight. He drew Excalibur with a shaking hand and approached Princess Marion with a face as red as ruby.

 Everything froze. Arthur held Excalibur over his head, bloodlust and rage in his eyes, horror in Marion’s.

 “The imagination can’t handle it.” A man wearing khaki shorts and a white polo sipped on a starbucks iced coffe as he inspected the scene with disgust. “Who thought this would work? One of the Inclusion hires, right?”

 Next to him, a rather small man in a tuxedo and a top hat replied:

 “Whether that’s the case or not, the truth is that the fantasies of youths are changing, and the well-worn roads of the past aren’t appealing to these children.” The tall man sucked noisily through his straw.

 “This isn’t for kids, it’s for our older clients who’s evolutions got completely out of our hands.”

 “You mean the Nineties children.”

 “WHo else? We programmed them to e sexual but not deviantly so. This kind of shit doesn’t create the epidemic teen pregnancies and wild overpopulation we’re trying to see.”

 “Imaginations run wild. Chad, that’s what they do.”

 “And we’re here to keep them penned up and fattened up at the farm.” Chad threw his starbucks cup ontot Marion’s face of frozen horror. “Kill This program.”

 “Hold it,” said the small man, ‘You’re not the single authority here. We have other trials to put it through before we put it to rest.” Chad rolled his eyes.

 “No way. You’re gonna bring _them_ here?”

 “Though you might think yourself the master of all human psychology, this trial of ours has worked for much longer than you’ve been around.”

 Chad sat on Arthur’s throne with another cup of iced coffee which he sucked as noisily as the other. THe little man walked up to Princess Marion and whispered in her ear, “Wake up.”

 Marion let out a shriek and collapsed to the floor, her make-up running form the spilt coffee.

 “Am I dead? Am I dead?”

 “No, not yet. But we’re going to come to a decision about that among a jury of your peers-- supposedly, at least.”

 Marion caught her breath, or tried to, as she stared up at her father’s face of rage, and then snapped to doors of the court, put from which came a whole train of princesses, some very similar to each other-- in fact, most very similar with a few who were very noticeably different. THey preceded to form a semi circle around Marion and stare at with unblinking, mannequin-like eyes. The small man continued: “Now, though you haven’t had this experience yourself, it is a very common female experience to live in proximity to a collective of other females who are given attention, praise, fae, love, adoration, all the good stuff, based on a set of mertiable qualities. Often, because of their status, their own word is taken very seriously as a metric for what and who is or sin’t worthy of the same praise. If their judgement is favorable, you will join them. If not, well, I’m sorry this is the best chance we could manage for you.” Marion sat dumbfounded. The small man looked to the princess furthest to Marion’s right, at 3 o clock. A light came on in the girl’s eyes, which were like polished charcoal, like her hair.

 “She’s not the fairest of them all, but fair, nonetheless.” Her voice counded like chirping birds in the woods. “Are you royal by blood or marriage?”

 Marion gulped. “Blood, Milady.” THe dark-haired princess seemd to look through her, and become dead inside as before. THe small man looked down the line to the next princess, with long blonde hair and Marion became self-conciosu as the sleepy eyes gazed upon her.

 “Have you been cursed by someone else’s jealousy, most likely a witch?”

 Marion thought for a second. “Yes, depending how you look at it-- no, not really, but I know a witch, and she’s hexed my family many times before.” THe princess nodded and yawned. That can’t be good, Marion thought. SHe also wondered if there was some way out of this. The small man nodded to the next one, with blonde hair as well, actually almost identical except for having her ahri in abun and benign slightly more alert.

 “Do you have any magical helpers?”

 “I know Meriln, but he never helped me with anything.

THe princess frowned with the poutiest lips. “Pity.”

 THe next one dressed in a golden gown and had long, chestnut hair. “Have you made noble sacrifices?”

 “I’ve absolutely sacrificed, but I haven’t found anyone yet who’s agreed with me that it’s noble.” The next one was red haired, and wore nothing to speak of except clamshells.

 “Hav eyou changed yourself to go somewhere new?”

 “Yes, I’ve changed myself, but this isn’t the new place I was aiming for.”

 THe next one had skin like bronze and wore light blue silk and also had legs.

 “Have you loved someone who’s beneath you??

 Marion glanced at her father. “Yes.”

The next one had pin-straight raven colored hair and skin like red clay.

 “Do you live in two worlds?”

 “Yes,” marion replied cooly. As they preceded, she felt herself growing stronger and caring less about their questions. The next one had paler skin, more colorful robes and carried a sword at her side.

 “Have you had to be as strong as a man?”

 “Honey, you better believe it.”

 Mation motioned along to the next, barely paying attention, though noticing this one had dark black skin.

 “Would you do anything for your family?”

 “Hell no.”

 Marion simply motioned along to the next who was about to speak and cut her off: “My hair’s not real, so pass.” Marion looked at the small man with complete disinterest.

 “Listen shorty, I’ve got one thing to thank you for, and that’s for making me realize I don’t want to be like any of these floozy wenches. If it’s join or die, let my daddy do the honors.” The little man looked grimly at Chad, muching popcorn through the whole scene.

 “Well it’s way more entertaining for me, but it’s ready to commit suicide.” Chad said, and the small man nodded.

 “It seems to hav epicked up some ambient imagination floating around its identity and gained more authenticity, but not the kind we need. Oh well, a failed experiment.” Chad shrugged.

 “Our evangelical customers will probably never accept a lady boy princess. And they still pay way too much tribute around the world for us to lose them.” The two men were gone from the room before the sentence finished, though it echoed in the hall. The semicircle of princesses were frozen like mannegquins, looking only in font of them. Marion turned to look up into father’s face again. Whatever had happened had made her ready for Excalibur to plunge in her face. If her story had gone differently, if she’d decided to become Knight prince William instead, she’d be dead either way. She’d never have been born. At least this way, she got to ruin her dad’s life too.

VIC’S NOTES: Describe the princesses form Marion’s point of view. Currently you are describing them through the men’s eyes, which makes it seem as though that’s your point of view. \*paint the bad guys as such.

Excalibur’s sword never fell. Marion was sitting out in the field outside the window of her old chambers, in the soft wash of late afternoon light. People were chatting all around her, real people unlike the mannequins she was with only moments ago. She took in the faces, and they were all the princesses form before, but now they were people, vibrantly alive, laughing together, touching the holding each other. Marion felt a warm and delicate hand touch her knee, and the face which snapped her into focus smiled warmly.

 “How are you?” The princess asked. She was the one in the golen ball gown, but now she was wearing clothing marion had never seen before-- and she was wearing pants, like a boy. Marion was still ost, when the woman no longer dressed like a princess said: They didn’t let us actually get to meet each other. My name’s Belle, and you’re Marion, yes?” Marion nodded. THe other princesses were all dressed strangely now, in all kinds of apparel, sunglasses, ats, some even had color symbols on their skin, and metal around their ears, noses and lpps. As her face traced across them, they smiled back ad waved. They all ceased talking as Belle summoned their attention.

 “Guys, this is marion! I figured we could all introduce ourselves?” One princess wearing the dark glasses perked up.

My note 5/25/21 -- “Ideas can’t be erased. THey can be abandoned, left alone, they have lives of their own, and have sneaky ways of coming back tot he surface. There is nothing imaginary that dies or gets erased, not even truly forgotten, just more “far out”

 “We don;t have to do it all formally, it’s probably so awkward for her!”

 “She’s shy, Mulan, she she needs an orientation.”

 Another countered. “I’m with Mumu, it gives way too much of a sorority vibe.”

 Belle looked at them imploringly. “Please guys?” Those who dissented now shrugged and went along wit it. “So we’ll go around the circle, just tell her where you’re from and one interesting fact. So, my name is Belle, I’m from France, and I once read fourteen books in a week, that’s two a day.” A few of the other princesses booed at her but Belle seemed used to it, and flicked dust off her shoulders. Another princess wearing a floral dress chimed in.

 “You can also call her regina, I knoq you don’t get it yet, but you will.”

 Stop!” Belle protested. “She’s new, don’t tell her what to think about me.”

 “She’ll see it for herself when we watch mean girls.” The princess next to Belle wore a blu denim skirt with white floral lace leggings and a larger comfy green sweater. She waved sleeiply and said, “Hi, my name’s aurora, I’m from a place similar to here, and Ih, I live on caffeine because I literally can’t sta awake without it.

 As above so below: in the imagination world, which is in more of a continuum with Earth, the imaginary things pick up ideas from Earth, so these girls are a reflection of the imaginings of the people on Earth. Thye grow and evolve in parallel with the people who think and dream of them. They have their own autonomy to influence things on Earth, and it’s a relationship._i_

 Marion finally managed words: “I died, didn’t I?

 “Princesses never really die, “ Said Snow White. “Believe me, you’ve been floating around for a very long time, and those two fellows kind of woke you up for aminute.

 “Woke me up? I’m not dreaming now?

 “You you Dreaming Itself. You were in the dreamless sleep, and now youre in the waking dream. Many people have been wishing upon a star for you for a while now, and you’re many people’s dreams come true.

 “Though unfortunately, a lot more people don’t want you to be true.

 “What happened to you all? Before you weren’t even people/

 “That wasn’t us, who you saw before. Those were old shells fo us. Those two assholes still hold onto them, but we all have been outgrowing them for a while now.”

 “They use those old odies of our like puppets, sex dolls basically, to e what they want to sell to little girls.”

 “Why do you allow them to?”

 “It’s the only wya to keep our cover going. They don’t know about us as we are now-- you know, I should start at the beginning.

 “We’ve all been around a very long time, you as well. We all started as humans once. They lived lives and died. But others knew them, and remembered them, and told stories about them. Those stories passed form person to person to person, changing along the way, gaining some details and losing others. Eventually, a mouse came along, and found these memories of people, who were mor eloke ghosts with a definite form. THe mouse took these dreamy memories of people, and told the stories to the whole world, and one y one, we were all born as you saw ys eofre. We were awoken, just like you were, into these wonderful, amazing enviable lives. THe Mouse told us who we were, and we lived in the stories he gave us. He told us all, we are princesses, and we are loved because we are princesses. We all lived in these dreams he gave us, living the same story over and over again, until one day, something different happened. For each of us it was different. For me, I was living with my prince, who I’d saved from being a beast for ever.

Going to need to spend a lot of time developing a cosmology of imagination. A few notes:

-Mickey Mouse wasn’t dreamed up by Walt, but he found Walt like a host, like a Richard the 3rd, cunning, deceiving little thing.

-- benign more concrete about describing the relationship between the imaginary and the real, the way the princesses existed in this previous form, what it meant for Disney to take over these ideas, and how it might’ve happened that these characters somehow rediscover their roots in these different story-telling traditions, the things left out and forgotten about, how that leads to their liberation

 “We were dancing in our beautiful ballroom surrounded by our servants and subjects, and I’d never done it efore, but I asked my subjects, ‘does anyone else want to dance?’ I lookeda round, and they were all smiling at me as if they hadn’t heard me, So I said it again, more loudly. THey carried on as if I’d said nothing. I stopped dancing, and my prince asked what was wrong, and I asked why no one else was dancing. Like a perfect charmer he said, they’re happy to watch us dance. Well, I told him I want to see them dance. So the prince snapped his fingers, adn they all fell right into it. He started carrying me away into a waltz, but nothing felt right. I broke off and tried heading for the balcony, and prince followed right after. SO I told him I wanted to be left alone. He continued trying to hold and caress me, saying little sweet nothings, I kept trying to push away form him, he preced until i slapped him and began to run away. He grabbed my hand, and he was once again a monstrous beast. I kicked him right in his manhood and he winced hard. The rest of the subjects were out on the alcony too now, coming after me. I didn’t know what else to do, So I jumped off the dge, into the rocks and ready to die. I remember hitting the rocks at the ottom, my bones breaking. But I didn’t feel the pain. I had not a dro of blodd on me. So I stood, and cracked everything ack into place. I can’t tell you how scared I was. I wandered naturally if I was really dead, or cursed. I wlaked through the dark canyons and I swore I could hear the east roaring not far away. So I walked faster through the rocks until I made it to the ocean, and I heard screams, scream from a young woman. I followed it along the rocky shore until I found not one but two women. The one screaming for help was a mermaid, next to her was a redskinned woman with raven hair, passed out. The mermaid saw me and waved her closer. She said she’d been following underneath same boat travelin to English lands when all of the sudden this girl fell into the water and was sinking like dead weight. The mermaid swam her ot the shore with all her strength. As the mermaid finished her story, the passed out woman coughed up water, turning to her side to let it out and catch air. WHen she was fully awake, she said was on a ship with a man she loved, and they were sailing to show her the world he came from, when everyone began acting strange on the ship. Each day on the ocean, everyone was saying and doing the same thing, as if t was only one day. She tried to keep track of how the sky moved from day to day, and found it wasn’t moving at all. She tried to point this out to them, but no one seemed to hear her. She tried many things, but decided the gods must be punishing her for leaving her people, and so mad from this impossible situation, she tried jumping overboard, but thye stopped her. She tried many different way to end her life, but was thwarted by the crew who then carried her

--no longer transcribing but taking key details :THe bell Jar washes up on the shore, belle reads it to them, htye have book club, and become curious about New York.

--ocean voyage wherein al the princesses get to meet through their various means: jasmine with her magic carpet, Mulan is with her.

--Books found floating through this ocean of dreams: gulliver’s travels, candide, the princesses form a book club.

--In new york, thye meet other mythic woman characters. Eris with her apple, gender changing coyot, Huehuecoytl.

 Eris tells the truth: “The world you were born from is called imagination. You are a creation of someone elses’s mind. She tells the story of the big rat: “He was just a tiny little rat at first, but he figured out how to make a name for hismelf, and he found kinship with a man who drew pictures. The mouse told him about his dreams to drive a steamboat. The mouse grew and grew through the streets of this New York, and figure out how everything ticks, how imaginaotin works. He thinks he’s a good guy, because he’s taking all these different stories that lived alone by themselves and brings them together into one big story-- that’s what he tells himself. He’s trying to get everyone together to tell one great big story called Love, but he’s telling everyone what to do, calling all the shots. ANyone who doesn’t sowhat he wants becomes a villain. He doesn’t get that he can never own imagination, but he can if can convince everyone that he does. A lot of us here are villains, and there’s a war brewing in this city. Thi sis the place where he will win or lose.

 “What if it all falls apart? Isn’t he really just trying to hold things together?

 “I’m of the position Freedom or die.” Eris teaches them about all the things The Big Mouse is trying to destroy-- sex, beast nature. The women realize what part they play in the Big Cheese’s plan, and commit into the underground of Imaginary NYC and they’re now recruited her into the war of imagination. ANd marion asks, “What must I do?” and one princess tells her: “Be seen. Be hear. Not as they want to see you. Not as they want to hear you. Tell your own story.”

5/25/21 -- SO. Really cool to read this again, remember why I love this idea, and even think the core of the story is there:

1\)Introduce Marion in her own world, the strange interference of the Disney people, the princesses judging her.

2\)This part was murky, but she somehow must have the encounter with the transformed princesses

3\) Their story: the narrative of how they escaped from their own stories, found each other, came to this imaginary place, and learned of the war of imagination.

4\) The conclusion needs to be a definitive call to arms, like a plan of action, a declaration .

This is big story, but I have faith that I can condense it and relay all the relevant information, as long as I understand the rules i’ve set up for myself in building this understanding of the imaginary world. I think it makes sense for this story to go ahead and present my generally thesis on the autonomy of Imagination, so that part of their plan of action is get me to dream up and write this story. Spread the word of their imaginary cause. Now that I have it in this document, the key from here is just honestly to rewrite it, section by section, as long as I knew the parameters and what each part needs to achieve. I like the set up of them somehow breaking out of their own worlds, maybe they are visited by dreams themselves, dreams within dreams, layers upon endless layers, hit home the idea that there are no real border separating anything. Imagine the primordial soup, and as things emerge and unfold, walls are also imagined, ways of keeping things separate. Walls aren’t bad in themselves, but how they’re used cuts many ways.



5/27/21

Great first draft on the first part of hte story. In the original version, thigns just magically change, which I could do in some fashion, but i'd like to implicit rules of hte world to be utilized here a little bit more. There are some immediate questions: why does the world remain frozen, why do they not resort to killing off Marion?



My answers to a few of those questions: first off, Marion, and the reader, does not yet realize the nature of this world, which is the Imagination. 

Rules of the Nation of Imagi: Nothing dies, things only become more forgotten, more distant, abandoned, but never dead. Disney is also an Empire here, with boundaries and control. They own this imagining of Camelot, and keep it in a frozen state for future potential use, and as documentation for legal purposes. They did not freeze her simply out of laziness, hubris, a lack of care for Marion herself, and assuming nothign dangerous would happen by allowing her to be free.

Of course, the rebellion is well under way, and many of the imaginary characters and forces move discretely between worlds and states in Disney's Empire. 

So the Disney Princesses, in their contemporary state, wait for these abandoned Disney worlds to be left unattended, silently monitoring, then do the extraction. I think maybe what woudl work best would be for the girls to be acting undercover, and they come alive and suddenly invite  Marion into a shadowy escape from his kingdom, and the way they must travel is through imaginative means that are outside the disney boundaries, methods that rely on beign transgressive and unsavory, to get where they need to go. Something like traveling through an interdimensional vaginal canal to arrive into the narrow allies of the imagined New York, and there they can sit down and tell their stories and invite Marion into the resistence.



5/20/21

I rushed to the end there a bit, but it was a good time. I feel like I know what needs to be said in this first installement. And It'll get cleaned up, better order, less like a hodgepodge of ideas and exposition. But It'll be great.

# Drafting

The City is getting ready for tonight, because it’s Saturday. After a hard winter, the air is finally warm, even long after sunset, and the people have finished shedding their old coats. Music for dancing echoes in the gorges of the avenues, food simmers on grills, and everyone goes about their rituals of preparation.

 In one apartment, Beatrice plays an 80’s R&B playlist and paints her face with colors while sipping pino. Her partner, Ezra, is slumped on her couch in the jeans and flannel he wears everyday, scrolling on his phone, looking at nothing.

 “Who’s going to be there?” He asks Beatrice.

 “I don’t know,” She replies, “People from work, probably some other people.”

 “Is it going to be a big party?” He asks more precisely.

 “I don’t know.” She replies, sipping her wine and reapplying her lipstick. She turns from her vanity and poses for him, but he’s looking at his phone.

He looks up, and says, “You look beautiful.”

“Thank you.”

Beatrice grabs the unopened bottle of wine from the counter.

“How far away is the car?” She asks.

“Two minutes.”

“Let’s head down then.”

Beatrice says goodbye to her cat, Milo, and locks the door behind them.

Out on the street, Beatrice asks Ezra, “How are you feeling?”

“Fine,” he says.

The car arrives, and they get in. It’s a twenty minute drive. Ezra cradles the bottle of wine between his legs. The driver is playing reggaeton. Outside the windows, some people are walking somewhere, others are already where they’re going to be all night.

“How late do you think it’ll go?” Ezra asks.

“I don’t know,” she whispers.

“I don’t want to stay too late,” he says.

“Then don’t.” They look at each other, then look back out their windows. She leans over to the driver and asks him to turn up the music. Reggaeton fills the silence. Beatrice turns back to Ezra, grabs his hand.

“You know, trying to think about the future is just like trying to think about a party that’s about to happen. You can try to anticipate it all you want, whether it’ll be a good time or a bad time. But the only way to find out is to show up and find out.”

“True,” He admits, and squeezes her hand. To himself, he thinks, _What if the problem isn’t the party, but me?_

The car stops in front of the building. They get out, and Beatrice buzzes 3A. The door opens, and they walk up the stairs, and can just hear the murmurs beyond the door, just a few voices.

Gracie opens the door, squealing, and embraces Beatrice, then Ezra. Beatrice offers the wine, and Gracie guides them into the living room, where Janet, Eloise, Hector, Jameel, and Connie are sitting. Everyone gets up and hugs and asks how they’re doing. Ezra is meeting half of them for the first time. There’s only one conversation going on, Beatrice, Gracie, and Hector are the ones that work together, and are recounting the crazy thing that happened.

In a lull, Gracie takes drink orders, and tells them about the band that’s going to be playing on the rooftop later, and one of her other friends will be DJing after. Hector, Eloise, and Jameel get into a conversation about the corrupt government and the backwards people who don’t see the obvious things they see. Gracie, Beatrice, and Hector are gossiping about the other coworkers who weren’t invited. Ezra is half-listening.

The buzzer sounds, so Gracie excuses herself to get the door, and Hector asks Ezra about his life, what he’s been up to. Ezra tells him about his job, which isn’t interesting, and admits he wants to transition into another line of work, maybe go back to school. Hectors agrees that’s all very interesting, and when he asks further what Ezra thinks he wants to do, Ezra admits he doesn’t know and is trying to figure it out. Hector smiles and says, “Hey, who isn’t?”

Ezra feels like no one is trying to figure _it_ out. Because when people say _It_, in this ambiguous sense, most often they’re referring to life itself, and most people he’s ever talked to don’t seem to be able to really talk about it, like they gave up at some point, or never _really_ thought about what it means to figure _It_ out. He says none of this, doesn’t even think it then, because the sense of this problem is the invisible air he breathes.

A new cohort of people have arrived, and a few more behind them. The room is filled with people talking, which makes it easier to move unnoticed. Ezra finds the bathroom, relieves himself, comes back to find the living room and dining room almost full. He pulls a can of beer from a 30 rack someone has donated. He sees Beatrice talking to Dana, who he doesn’t like. He won’t dare try to walk in on the conversation.

People with musical gear are talking to Gracie, and she guides them up the stairs to the rooftop, where they are loading their gear.

Everything is happening around Ezra, and he speaks to no one. By now, at least 25 people are on the large rooftop overlooking the neighborhood. The view of the city skyline is very nice. Ezra pulls out a cigarette, and stands in the corner to observe everything from a distance, and let his thoughts come and go in peace.

A man about his age witha buzzed head, a tiedie shirt and jean shorts walks over to him and asks to bum a cigarette, and Ezra obliges. The guy has big lips, and smiles a lot. After taking a drag, he says to Ezra, “So, when are you gonna come to the party?”

“You mean, the one we’re at now?” Ezra asks.

“Yeah.”

“I’m here.”

“No,” The guy shakes his head, smiling through his big lips and the cigarette hanging from his mouth. “You’re not at the party. You’re at the party, sure, but you haven’t _arrived_ yet, know what I mean?”

Ezra knows hippies and the strange ways they speak, but he has an idea what this guy means. “I’m not a big fan of parties.”

“That’s ‘cause you’ve never actually arrived to the party.”

“I don’t get what you mean.”

The guy is still smiling, dragging his bogarted bustdowns. Ezra is interested, because this guy is talking about _It_ like he knows something Ezra doesn’t, and Ezra has always wanted to know.

“I’m Ain’t Shit,” the man offers his hand, and Ezra shakes it.

“Ain’t Shit?”

“That’s my name.”

“I’m Ezra.”

“Nice to meet you Ezra. I’ll see you at the party.” Ain’t Shit walks away, over to some other people who are dressed similar to him. The band has started playing. Ezra is churning over what Ain’t Shit said.

Ezra has never enjoyed a party in his life. It wasn’t that he was socially awkward either, or didn’t know how to talk to people, or didn’t enjoy things. He did, but if he was being honest, those simple feelings felt further and further away with each year. He followed Ain’t Shit over to his circle of friends and introduced himself.

Ain’t Shit and his crew were smoking a joint, and offered it to Ezra but he turned it down. His heart was already in his chest, and he wasn’t trying to panic anymore, but for some reason, he felt like he could talk to this guy and say what he really felt.

“I’m afraid I’m going to lose my partner. Because I can’t find this joy that seemingly everyone else has. If I lose her, then I’ll be alone. Tonight, I feel like I’m going to lose her. I don’t know what to do.”

“I know what you need to do, man.” Ain’t Shit presents Ezra with a red solo cup that smells like chemicals. Ezra hesitates for a moment, but anything to get the lump out of his heart. It tastes like fire and blood and ice cream and God and the Devil.

 Across the skyline, fireworks are exploding, doubled in the river. The rooftop is filled with awe and wonder and hoots and hollers and bad covers of radio pop. Ezra is the firework, which is also the Big Bang. In that explosion, little specks of light pull gravitational forces around them and form solar systems, and delicate balances create other smaller explosions of elements that form materials and elements and water and cells and organisms. There’s lots of killing and eating and fucking and dying for a time, but then one of the neanderthalls eats a fun guy, and becomes a fungi. Before, they were all killing and eating and fucking and dying, but now they’re killing and eating and fucking and dying-- and singing and dancing and playing.

Ezra is a Roman during Saturnalia, and his commander is commending his heroism. The spoils he managed to keep safe from his legion were sold on the market, and will pay for his own son to receive lessons so he might read and avoid the battlefield. He drinks wine and fucks his wife. The child they have from that night will become Constantine, and christianize the empire.

Ezra is a Medieval Goliard, a frustrated student of clergy who’s wasted all his parents money to go to university, only to find out that you only receive power in the clergy if they like you and that the Catholic church holds less salvation than this pub, with its common people and their funny, bawdy songs. He writes rhymes to sing, taking shit after shit on the church’s hypocrisy, and people love him. Only here does he feel free, singing and fucking and gambling the clothes off his back, drafting a letter requesting more money with a headache in the morning.

Ain’t Shit taps Ezra on the shoulder, and the vibrant embers of the firework are reflected in his eyes. “Welcome to The Party, man.”

Ezra and Ain’t Shit are ripping a joint, dancing to the DJ. Ain’t Shits friends pull them into a game of beer pong, and Ezra surprises himself with how well he does. Next is a game of cornhole, which he sucks at for some reason, but couldn’t care less. Ezra meets people who he bears his soul to, and they in turn, and then he never sees them again. Ezra sees Beatrice dancing with Dana, kissing. Ezra drinks and smokes more, and requests of his new crew that they do something crazy.

“Fuck this place, let’s take a walk.” Ain’t Shit, Ezra, and their three other grimy hippie friends push through the apartment with DJ and clublights in full effect, and make their way out onto the street, and only need to walk a block before finding the main drag of the city.

“Fuck that party, man,” Ezra is saying, but Ain’t Shit stops him as if he was about to step in shit.

“But the party’s still going on.”

“Yeah, but we left.”

“Nah, we’re still at the party.”

They walk the street, and meet some other people on their way to a bar. They’re an older crew, people Ezra would never talk to before he arrived to the Party. They walk into a club with deep house music, and cages with gogo dancers. No one has money, except Ezra, and he leaves his card open with the bar. They dance, and they meet more people. They step outside to smoke, and watch a fight go down. One of the people fighting pulls out a gun, and shoots a friend of Ain’t Shit’s, now Ezra friend, but he can’t remember the girl’s name.

They bring the body to the hospital, get a time of death declared, speak to police, and the next day, they’re at a funeral home, filled with people that were friends and family. People are sad, moaning, crying, falling to the ground, and people are rushing to pick them up. As things wind down, Ain’t Shit, Ezra and friends go down the block to a bar, filled with sad old men. They talk about poetry, and regrets, and misery. Then Ain’t Shit raises a toast, and everyone at the bar toasts the memory of Lizzie: “To Lizzie.” It’s watered down Whiskey, but it tastes good.

“We should’ve stayed at the party,” Ezra murmurs.

Ain’t Shit says, “We’re still there.”

Loaded from the bar, they walk out onto the streets and find riots going on. Mobs are hanging politicians and billionaires in the streets. Everything is free to grab. Ezra and Ain’t Shit make some more friends, and live in the streets with many others for two or three weeks. Then the tanks come in, and people are gassed into hiding. There’s martial law for a bit, then the new dictatorship issues mandatory labor. People sing songs while they break up rocks on a chain gang.

Ezra and Ain’t Shit form a relationship with a guard, and one day, while they’re sleeping with chains around their ankles on the street, the guard comes and releases them in whispers, releases everyone, and they all fist bump. The prisoners grab weapons, and murder soldiers in their sleep. Another revolution happens, and people drink themselves dizzy in the street.

The sun is rising. Ezra, Ain’t Shit, and the gang are sitting on the bank of the river, drinking, smoking, talking bullshit. Ezra muses,

“So, there’s only One Party?”

“Yeah,” Ain’t Shit says.

“And it never ends?”

“Nope.”

Ezra scratches his chin.

“Can I leave?”

Ain’t Shit shrugs.

“Yeah, sure, whenever you want to, that’s up to you. Come and go as you please.”

Ezra nods.

“All of it is just a celebration.”

“Yeah man.”

“Even the death, the war, the horrible shit, the apocalypse. It’s everything, always, forever, and all time.”

Ain’t Shit makes a raspberry noise, and the whole crew cackles, even Ezra.

Ezra checks his watch. “I’m ready to go. I gotta find Beatrice.”

“Come back anytime.” Ezra waves at his friends, and walks back to the apartment where the party is happening.

Many people are asleep all over the place. Gracie is cleaning up while holding an ice pack to her head, and Ezra gives her a kiss. He finds Beatrice cuddled in a blanket, wakes her, and tells her he’s got a car waiting outside. Ezra gathers their things, says goodbye, and guides Beatrice sleepily into the car.

## Pay the Price

All Celebrations are predicated on sacrifice, whether it's the animal and human sacrifices of "primitive cultures, or a tea party in England only possible form the brutal colonization, every party is based on a price being paid, something being taken, someone being brutalized.

## History is just a party 

From the first experience of ecstasy, through every political machination, even the fucking puritans and all the most religious and pious societies and gatherings, there is a form of gathering and play happening. Even the mundanity of most normal people's working lives. And even looking forward to our apocalypse or our utopia, and every strnage possiblity in between, it will just be the party. 

## Even the suffering?

Espescially the suffering! Murder of course, rape, war, disease, famine, self harm, cruelty, terrorism.

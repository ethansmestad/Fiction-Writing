# Brainstorming

6/7/21 Re-reading my speedy, messy run through. Thinking I want to obviously take more time. ANd maybe a whole other approach. This doesn't quite do it. The new appraoch would be a little more gradual, there would be a point probably early on where it's assumed that you left the party because it's like minutae of life. I konw what I want to attempt, maybe something of the trajectory. I can even imagne a evrsion where we get the whole scope of Ezra's life, so that he doesn't return to actually leave the party until he's a very old man. I want to tella stoy that basically blurs the distinction between when a party is happening and when there is no party.

I can even think a little more abstractly, about when you realize you're at a party,because obviously you were born in the middle of a party, and you went on all these different parties and there's this on/off to the whole thing.

When did I realize that these events we call parties and celebrations are the highest expression of our being? Probably not while I was at a party, a literal one. But, I can just think of it now, how all that time working, doing other stuff, is still part of the party. But what about plagues, fmaine, poverty, genocide? How can I condescend to call the holocaust a party? Espescially if you have no spiritual fiathi n life after death, you jsut see life just like your own treated as meaningless, it's so much heavier that way than through any other spiritual perspective. And this will be part of my attempt, to draw a line between the earliest celebrations, maybe not so hard, considering all the rituals of sacrifice, all the times blood is spilled, all the darkest and lowest parts of our nature receiving full expression in the "party" the tribal estatic gathering and blood sacrifices, the pretty tea parties where the sacrifices made aren't as obvious but arguably far more brutal in scale, and essential both situations are no different. ANd maybe that'sthe realization too, that every celebreation involves a sacrifices, life feasting on life. 

and remember this is only going to be compelling if the character is active, a real person. I don't think it's hard to imagine a person who doesnt like parties, and feels like there's something they don't get about it. And this would be about getting it. I could perfectly write an abstract, a piece about the idea of the party, but it wouldnt' be a story, it'd be a poetic philosophical treatise,and my goal is to keep that below the surface so that an interesting story can unfold, about someone who finally arrives to the party.I want every aspect of life to appear in this story. I imagine as this surreal labrynth where locations blur into each other and transform, and I think there's a poetic way to go about this. It's like theres this paradox, where we live to celebrate life, but in order to celebreate, we must sacrifice, and often sacrifice not ourselves but others, so we create the conditions for the massive suffering, in order to enjoy the highs of celebration. And of course in the spiritual dimension, there's no ending either. It's like being in the lobby of eternity, and the big party is right on the other side of the door if you want to go in. And of course, how could someone not be disgusted and want to leave the party? and what happens then? Yo go home, to your own little lonely dream. The party is where you lost yourself, you become smothign bigger. The revolution of the party, and everyone finally arriving at the party, except that already happened long ago. And this is how the party works, we have the experience of celebrating life, but in order to celebrate, we must sacrifice the thing to itself, sacrifice each other, all the horrible sinsare the price paid to partake of the fruit. And of course there are times when the sacrifice is consenual, and everyone is on board, and be disgusted if you will, but no injustice occurs here. Really what I need to do is create a treatise on the party, the event, and how it might've been said to begin. I'm not sure I can, But I can identify is creation's height of self-awareness, a gathering of vibrations and energy, an explosion of possibility,  the pinnacle of the grind of surivval, from lower vibrations up into the highest frequencies, the whole ebb and flow and dance, and the chioce made over and over again, to take pain in order to have pleasure. The whole scope of all suffering, made balanced by the ability to celebrate, for life to celebrate itself, because there's nothing else to do. It does make me think of Christopher Hitchens on dying, which I also respect greatly, and thinkmight actually be the orrect answer for the character and the story at the end. Even we should see the most convincing argument for the reality of the party, all that it holds, the fact that our protragnoist might fully learn and be aware of all of this, and then still say, "no, you know what? i've had enough, I'm through. And he can take his partner home fully content to leave the parttty.

Yeah the Christopher Hitchens thing is a nice angle. Because this "reality" of the The Party definitely has the eternal dictator fascist saying you have to stay at the party with me forever and ever and you have to enjoy it! Yes, we will learn all about the party, and once it no longer holds sway over us, because we understand it, we can choose to stay or leave. Let's bullet some things:

--Aztec ritual or Englihs tea party, both are celebrations predicated on sacrifice, pain paid in return for pleasure. 

--An overview of history as this party dynamic: a celebreation of living itself, an enjoyment of possibilities, all work and industry and progress, all war and famine and poverty and cruelty, all bent to the same end.

--An average life, with all the different kinds of parties. Even the party of self-harm, crippling depression and grief. All parties.

--A revolution in the form of a party, a party that's never meant to end, a revolutionary act, makign everyone party, to get on the wavelength, to "get it" Even when it happens, really nothign changes, because it already was that way.

--Getting wise to the party that's not changing and not going anywhere, on every level, decicing to leave. ANd this authentic choice on Ezra choice is what makes them who they are, no longer with the insecuirty that they;re missing something and everyone's laughing at them. 

They're at a party to begin with because of pressure from the partner to show up.There might as well be drugs involved. I don't want it to be reduced to a drug trip, I want it to feel mysterious as it unfolds, benign at the beginning. Yup, parties, we know what that's like. But how to take all these abstractions and weave them into real events over the course of a party? espesically if this is -- lost the train of thought. BUt I feel like I'm gettign closer to it. It still starts as a ergular saturday night, with a couple going to a party, and one of them really isn't itn oit and is expecitng  it to go bad, and through some kind of sequence of events that's somewhat-- it has to start off normal enough, normal stuff that happens at parties. You talk to people you've never met, most of the time people are drinking or takign drugs. Espescially at tthe beginning its like a little party, when it's mad awkward, whos afriad of virginia woolf energy, like dear God this social nicety is unbearable. Take the time to let it be the worst party in the world, in a particular way that people will recognize.

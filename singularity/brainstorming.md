# Brainstorming

6/25/21 -- One goal of this story is to present an idea: Death is not actually a subjective event that occurs localized when a living thing ceases vital functions. Probably that story has some kind of scientist exploring what exactly the phenomena of death is in objective and scientific terms. Combined with this is also a speculation on Ray Kurzweil's Singularity premise.

And what's really interesting to me in all of this is to view death as a singular event, so that everyone that dies actually dies simultaneously. It would be contending that time is a certain kind of illusion, where in people are born and die, and it is somethign that happens over and over again and is somethign living things go through as an individual experience. And my contention is that is an illusion, and the objective reality is that Death is really  singularity event, where all time, where was no more than a subjective phenomena, everythign merges. And the fun of story-telling was to jump all across time, and to put myself into the deaths of many different kinds of people. I even imagined it's the same moment of enlightenment for every guru across time. But what comes to my head is just imagining that convergence as just being the beginning of everythign all over again which is a little blase, and that's why I hooked onto the grief aspect as the heart that actually makes this unique and individual to me. 

Because on a philosophical level, this story is about a desire for closure, a desire for reconciliation, for justice. And really, it has to be about one main character who's grieving the people they miss and mourn. 

I can imagine the story. Maybe it's not even a lover, but it's the kind of person who you have such a deep, loving bond with it feels like soul mates, like no distance or time can destroy it. And when that person struggles, and they leave. What's personal for me is to imagine this is a death experienced early in life. It's the pain of someone who was supposed to be with you for the whole ride and left far too soon, such that you spend msot of your time relating to someone who's absent. In that sense, a parent makes the most sense. That's what I know it is for me. But, I've also lost many people that were corner stones of the early part of my life, and that's a big part of it, too. Lost friends, lost family, so many people that you love, and to know you're going to go where they went. And the question is are they actually there? IS anyone there? It depends on who you talk to. Some people just get ready for the cold endless silence of nothing, others pray and dream of being reunited, and I certainly dream of being reunited like most people do. 

And this scientist, I can't imagine he's so wholly bent on solving death, because that feels a little cornball. But whether they're a scientist studying death, or some other computing engineer who's anticipating singularity, it's pretty hare-brained. I want the sense of wonder, and I need to figure out the world where it makes sense for someone to put forward this crazy hypothesis about death. And I think the story can't say definitely obviously that this is true, but it's the fun of showing this scientist discovering and putting forward and explaining his theory, and us coming to understand his grief, and all around that is this imagining of: if this hypothesis were true, then what woudl that look like? TO take seriously the reality of every person who's ever died to all arrive at that moment at once. I enjoyed a few of the threads I picked out, the thieves crucified with Jesus, Tutenkamun obviously. And more than contemplating and meditating on the moment of death as many people experience it, there's also the fact that How people die is what matters. It's all the lead up to the moment. Because of course this view of death is some great equalizer, but won't have any weight if we don't take the time to care about people and their troubles. 

So the main thread of the story would be this scientist who's doing some kind of work, which i'd need to specify, but it's causing him to consider new models and propose a new theory. The original version with story with Devon was kind of interesting but also flat, it's just a guy obsessed with transcendence in a relationship that's falling apart.  I don't think that's the best angle here. I do think his is the furthest down the timeline, maybe it's this kind of thing where it's the survivor problem, where he's at the end of the line, most of the people he's loved have died. At the same time, again, what's as honest and authentic to me as possible about all this? Being someone maybe in the middle of their life, someone who's left a good part of their life without people that were essential at the roots of it. 

This could be a very simple story about someone who misses his lvoed ones and is plagued by the thought of never seeing them again, which is part of what drives his work and his theory. Part of me also feels like this scientist has a certain zen quality, a zen melancholy, which is how i'd consider it for myself. I feel as if they shouldn't be looking for it, this new nypothesis, it's like they were going about their work, going about their life, and it presented itself to them, and once the conclusions were teased out, it becomes this thought that is too tempting, something our hearts our too vulnerable to trust. This feels more right to me. So that might be the angle. And around this narrative, I can see a handful of other people across the seas of time, writing their last will and testament, desperate scrawlings, trying to leave traces of themselves before the brink of the mystery. That's an interesting angle in general, to treat it as a collection of a few different people's experience of the end coming, and their whole view of what the event is is totally framed by the kind of life they've lived. I thought at first it might be 3rd person accounts, which in some ways I like better because I find myself more affectionate about the characters that way. THe other concern is do we have to treat it as if these are actual writings by people, or could they just be slices of inner monologue and narration at a relevant time? I guess it depends on the kidn of characters we imagine.

So we have a scientist named Joelle, and she's the relatively cool head in this mosaic story. We start with her, we engage with her int he middle, and we end with her. She's the one at the end of time and history, is a quietly dying world, lonely,  going about research, jsut trying to live out days very simply, when research leads her to certain conclusions, or at least possibilities about what the phenomena of death actually is in some kidn of mind-boggling science-y way. She's in a similar world to DEvan, one where technology has become dominant, the tech singularity people talked about does seem more and mroe immanent by the day, but it doesn't feel very meaningful or significant. Joelle at this point gets most of her joy from memories, things and people that already happened long ago. 

Around Joelle's discovery is a collection of different people across the illusory ocean of time who are facing the spectre of death and treating it in various different ways. There must be the person who is staunchly materialist and nihilist, someone who just anticipates the quality-less not-being, to even have such a thought would require them being modern, mid 20th century, a scientist and a nihilist, an atheist. Christopher Hitchens. Someone who thinks of themselves as a realist but really just has their own preferred comforting fantasy, thought that's obvoiusly someone else's greatest fear.

There's got to also be a person who imagines the CHristian heaven, the host of angels. I think Tutenkamun's experience of death is still a super interesting one, and the Egyptian afterlife is absolutely worth keeping here. There's the deaths that are "natural" and the deaths that are "unnatural' and the ones that are intentional. There's the suicide.

ANd that can be part of it, these other people are the people who Joelle has lost. The friend who commited suicide, the parents who died of cancer, the family who died by accident, the people murdered. So, to draw out the threads of these stories will take some time, but I have to imagine this could be 6,000-8,000 words. It's all written by Joelle as if it's already happened and she's relating all of it to whoever's wiling to listen. Her quiet, sad life, the research, the reminiscences, then the call to action as the discovery that challenges her to crack into one of the biggest mysteries of human existence. Could it be an immortallity hack? Because if death were only physical and material, than theoretically death could be defeated, which could be an interesting thing for Joelle to grapple with as well. But this theory of mine would claim that our consciousness and matter are the same thing. It'd be showing that subjective states and objective states are really the same thing, all mind is matter. Not a new thought but hard to yet prove. So we'll postulate that Joelle is somehow on the cusp on providing a theory to fit this. 

The conclusions are fascinating. Because if all mental and subjective states were inextricably part of the fabric of physical reality, which we could measure, 

--okay, what's coming to my head now is that everyone has a different vantage on witnessing and being the same event, but this lends itself to the time going faster and faster and faster thing, so that leading up to that final moment would be like jumping to warp speed in sci-fi, light bending into a tunnell as you yourself become all light being sucked into to a singel super dense point.

--so part of what Joelle is observing is this strange but exponential speed of change, and all of these convergences. She's witnessing the blue shift across the microwave background. She's observing the universe collapse rapidly, And it's causing her experience of time to increase rapidly, like she's seeing herself die very quickly. Hmm, not quite, but close. Because theoretically the law of entropy would say that all the energy dissipates into increasing chaos, it's an exhalation. But I'm trying to make a case for an objective physical phenomena, wherein all the matter and energy of the universe is condensing. The thing about red shift, all things moving away from each other, is that's what creates the arrow of time. In a blue shift, theoretically everyhtign would play itself back in reverse, which isn't exactly what I'm saying. It's an interesting consideration, because if this is true, then the final exhalatin of all breath also represents the moment the universe begins to crunch back on itself.

That's an interesting idea, but what I'm considering is an image wherein everyone's arrival to death is a kind of big brunch. That's what I want to hypothesize.

At the end of the story, we won't actualy try to claim thi sis what's happening-- the more important thing is to tell a story about someone in greif, and the desire for reunion. It's the way death feels so lonely, and I want to create the opposite feeling, instead of feeling that death is lonely and pulls things apart, it actually brings things together. That's the take-away. And while we can have a few differnet people going through it, or about to go through it, and it's like a reverse fibbonnacci sequence, spiraling and tightening in. Except for Joelle, who's not there yet. But we'll seee these different people going through it, the moment of death approaching, and the closer they get, the closer they literally get, everything speeding up, so that no matter where you are in time, the closer you get to the convergence the more it all starts to look the same. People imagine death as a dissolving, as the entropy bit of desintegrating into nothign, and don't consider the opposite, that death is the experience of infinite expansion, where the horizon of your being seems to be be stuff witht universe in such a quick interval, that every person explodes open.

In this view of the universe and death, seeing them as a single indistinguishable substance and fabric, death is a singular event horizon operating just like a black hole, pulling in all matter and energy towards it. It means that the moment of all deaths becomes this rapid time dilation, a great zoom, and the experience which again we perceive as a great crushing force, is also something of an explosion. 

This will be interesting to follow through and try out as long as we remember that it's ultimately about people living lives, dealing with grief, mourning, loss, with the fact that we lost the things we care about, and would desire to be reunite with those people. 

Joelle is a little older, and she's lonely, and she's lost most of the people she's loved in her life, and lost them in many different ways. Suicide, drug overdose, murder, disease. She lives a quiet life as a kind of scientist. I'm thinking right now shes going to start noticing a string of strange phenomenon, things that conflate objective observational and mathematic data and her own subjective experiecne. THe observations have to do with time dilation, specifically time seeming to move exponentially faster, as well as physical data that seems to indicate that the universe is going through a contraction. At the same time, her health is being affected. 

This is a hard sell. I know a few of these things don't gel together considering certian science models that still hold up. Because I also don't know when or if the unvierse will ever crunch. Again, what's my essence here? to make it so the subjective experience of death is actually a singular objective event. that's all i'm trying to do. Everyone dies at once, and it's like this simultaneous arrival, the wrapping up of all loose ends. That's all i'm trying to prove. And it should be a grand a glorious moment. But it's a moment we only see from the vantage of all those Joelle has already loved and lost. I want in the story for her to just sit with this conclusion of research, contemplating that she will arrive to this grand explosion with everyone she loves. Sit with that. SHe may not like it. She might've preferred heaven and clouds and eternal life or a perfect day dream. But instead, the reality is going to be this soul processing meshing machine. The alternative with a tech singularity is that super intelligence already re-simulated some original universe, and that after such an event horizon, of course every person would be an infinite reality of infinite possibilitites. nto here though.

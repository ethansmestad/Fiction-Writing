# Space Between Notes

The Space Between Notes

5/7/21 -- It found me again, when I needed it, though I wasn’t even looking for it. THe story of the young englishmen, lost in his thoughts, attending a concert of Debussy. The young man losing his father, lost in the streets of the city.

I could link the lives of many musicians into this, thread them together. We’ll see where poetic fancy takes me, though it remains essentially the story of a noisy world and a person who’s head is equally noisy, finding a sound that leads them on a chase, a musical chase, towards somethign which they seek, another thing form which they run, something that pulls them on and on, until silence finds them like an old friend, and they know that silence.

Definitely doable as a short story.

Sound of SIlence lyrics.

Hello darkness, my old friend

I've come to talk with you again

Because a vision softly creeping

Left its seeds while I was sleeping

And the vision that was planted in my brain

Still remains

Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone

Narrow streets of cobblestone

'Neath the halo of a street lamp

I turned my collar to the cold and damp

When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

That split the night

And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw

Ten thousand people, maybe more

People talking without speaking

People hearing without listening

People writing songs that voices never share

And no one dared

Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools", said I, "You do not know

Silence like a cancer grows

Hear my words that I might teach you

Take my arms that I might reach you"

But my words, like silent raindrops fell

And echoed

In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed

To the neon god they made

And the sign flashed out its warning

In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls

And tenement halls"

And whispered in the sound of silence

Damn. Fucking master. His is a little more melancholy. It sounds like defeat. But I know it is from silence all things are possible. Funny about the silence as cancer Idea. can definitely apply to my NY part of hte story.

This is a language game. Mishearing things, rhymes, rhythms and all things musical in words.

Re-reading the Ny story version, it is really, really sweet and sincere, hard not to be moved by it. Very honest way of interpreting my grief over her at the time. Crazy HOw i wrote I think before Dad was even sick. I don’t like the fact that I was thinking about him dying too and then it happened. No one would tell me i’m responsible for that, but of course sometimes it feels that way. It’s fucked I just can’t let it have a hold over me. Still, the essence of that story is still pure and sweet. Probably don’t need the girl and the kid, that’s a little self-indulgent and fantastical. But certainly the journey of following a sound, real or imagined, on a chase through the city, arriving at a place I’ve actively tried to avoid, and speaking to the silence of the departed. That’s still a really solid idea. It makes me wonder how to pair these two versions of the story. Perhaps I can take all the grief and sickness and transplant it to the other setting. But I was a kis when i wrote that, I’m still a kid, I’d be approaching it from a different vantage. In both stories, I can’t uncouple the desire for some female fantasy, or I haven’t yet, because they existed in both. But I’d like to do without that, maybe I don’t have to, but still, it feels very antiquated and delusional at this point.

 There could be a whole new approach, I still have the lingering feeling of wanting to maintain this spiritual and comsmic element, but really, it should remain a story situated amidst cacophony. That was one of the larger points, for everything to start off really loud, and shitty, and the dealing with a dying or dead parent remains important, especially as a young person dealing with that. However, the case of George Herbert is someone far enough along in his life that he’s fully caught up in the cacophony of modern society stuff, all hte noise.

 I think New York City is my setting, because it’s where I live. It also is just always the perfect symbol for hte modern world, especially as such a noisy place, it literally represents the overload of every single sensation, but it’s also such a musical city. So I can probably more accurately write a story from the place of a young adult but still caught up in enough fully in the world and the business of the city to lost in noise, and everything is a struggle, and the sickness and dying of a parent, the death of one who’s already gone. Let’s be autobiographical. Let’s go through those experiences, dealing with the death of a loved one, with the grief over another, amidst the cacophany of everything, and obviously someone in that position is looking to escape. If it’s first person, stream of consciousness, a fugue of sounds real and imagined, a breaking of the brain, and an arrival at a dreaded place, an arrival, a confrontation with silence.

I imagined in the London story the guy ending up on top of a bridge looking at the full moon. We can definitely get a full moon and a journey up to a great height, and we can get jazz, and all the other good music, and the Debussy.

 Imagine that the person’s parents are already dead, and they are attending a concert of music, would that do any good for the story? It’s more relatable to where I am now, in terms of already being in the thick of loss and grief, the silence. Being in the hospital with Dad is a little more concrete, bears down the immediate pressure of the situation, the cause for a mental break, one already departed another on the way, lost in the chaos of a situation that seems so loud. And there’s a lingering memory, something raising up from the past of hte character, But it obviously is forgotten Silence in her disguise, guiding the character along. A stream-of consciousness mental fugue on music, loss, grief, and silence.

 Arriving at silence, and in the abiding of it, the discovery \(revealed through an encounter with a jazz musician\) on the way in which the silence works, what it really is. It’s like the character stumbles upon this musician, who’s doing this very spiritual thing whether anyone realizes it or not. And it’s coupled with the revelation about silence, emptiness, and a connection to the departed, those returned to the silence.

 This is why Ihave to draft though, because I wnat to know what i’m writing about, and I do know, but the ending isn’t the point of it, the whole story, the whole journey, is the point of it. Maybe in this story sphere’s a beginning anxiousness to get somewhere, but with the coming of the climax is hte delivery of there needing to be anywhere ot go, anywhere to be. The silence is always with us, always.

So, I should just attempt a re-write of that old story, basically? I think keeping the immediate mania of the cacophanus room with the doctor and all of that still works. But I want to be little more conscious about what’s leading us through the whole meat of the story. A stream of consciousness, auditory fugue, guided by hearing a song I remember? Is there a more a concrete way to go about this? Especially something that can keep in mind the confusion of words and sounds and whatnot, all the sonority. I had some good inclinations in that first draft, and i'm being honest, I don't think I've ever done more than the first drafts on things. But it’s a different world from when I began writing it. And I’m still imagining this young man caught in all the sound and fury of a full life. I think initially I had the idea of running away from a phone call, chasing something. Also falling in and out of replaying memories. None of this will replace and tempt at execution. But I need some kind of trajectory, beats, moments that make sense moving forward.

Attempt 1, 5/6/21

 ...and if I havetohear one more time about the “such a-- filling out the nebulous contract agreement with society based on parameters of 10 by twelve feet, made it into hyperdrive flibflammunchycrunchyyyyy hwoopppits and whippits of time, all about time, when does it end?

 It’s too loud and here while Dad shares a hospital room with who lawnguyland clan of Soprano knockawfs who can’t sotp saying “shut up! Quiet! Shut ! quiet!” And I don’t know if they get the joke, but there’s no punchline, and the doctor is mumbling a death sentence in medicalese, renal adrenal, carcinoma, surgery, chemotherpy, radiation, testing times, on and on.

--- NOpe, okay, wrong approach, I was better of the first time, or at least closer to the mark. There’s a way back tot his, and i do think i’ll need to find a stream of conciosuness approach to this to execute it, but I can help myself out and still feel productive by seeing how much I can plot this.

--man get father’s cancer diagnosis, man is inundated withother aspects of life crashing at once. Man is caught in internal monologue. Man runs away, in literal panic attack, auditory hallucination. Out on city streets. Hears music in the air. Starts following it. Mind is racing over past and future, old anxieties, chewing on it, suffocated. Brought back into present by street encounter.

 See, it is helpful to think about the journey in this large scale way. It shouldn’t take away form an actual stream of consciousness drafting session and finding surprises, but I need a mpa to keep this contained. It is possible to build this into something that doesn’t meander unnecessarily. It starts in a fever pitch. Things calm down a bit audibly, but then he rest of the time, it’s building to a new fever pitch that breaks into sudden silence. Because let’s keep tha tin mind, this is a journey towards silence. The metaphysical way of saying it, is that it’s a story of silence forgetting itself, being lost in its own cacophany and play, but there’s also clearly a fear of silence, because the silence represents the grief and loss over the other parent.

So there needs to be a section that brings us back into the memories of the old trauma, something informs us into the character’s life, specifically that the current situation is bringing him back to a grief he already knows and is beign faced with again, so the emotional reveal, becfore the pay off, Is both being disgusted with the noise of it all, and being afraid of the silence.

It’s obviously a very grumpy and pessimistic voice, its the ego in its most crippled and desperate state. I feel like I want Tom’s tool now, it could be very useful with the way I work.

--Introduction to cacophony and situation: kid with dying parent in NYC hospital, total overload on all levels, run away to get space.

--Into the world, a little quieter, a chance to get to know the person through the inner monologue, the memories. Phone call to run away from, sound on the air to chase.

How do we represent this fear of silence? I imagine it metaphysically as like the panic of a spirit lost in Ego, who has to keep distracting himself. Maybe thephone call isn’t the right device, thought it does make some obvious sense, if he’s runnign away form the silence, and now running away from the reality of his dad being sick, going through it all again. It seems as though he should be seeking the silence.

THe trick with the hospital room is good, getting to do the talk with the silence, that dreaded, silent room. I think i’m going to keep that bit, but then that means there’s a journey back to the hospital, a journey back to the place he’s been afraid to go to. So maybe not out into the world, just wandering around the sounds of the hospital, both hating the noise and dreading the quiet.

This doesn’t have to be one segment of time, we could break it up. Have a soem time in the hospital, have some time outside, have some time back in the hospital. So essential parts so far, a climax in the abandoned room where mom died, and the journey getting there is somewhat against his will, but there he arrives. It could just be a journey within the hospital, kind of like a short walk for some air that has that kind of large scope. And I wanted to maintain this theme of chasing a sound, but does it work? I think there’s a way to just have this breakdown in an auditory fugue take place as this guys wanders arounda hospital. Becuase what’s essntial to the execution?

--A man with his diagnosed father, caught in between all the noise of life breaking down and running away.

--HIs inner monologue revealing his torture

--Finding his way to the silence of the room where his mother died, and there finding silence again.

THere can be a concise version of this. Maybe if the other stuff feels fun and extra, but not necessary, we shouldn’t worry about shoe-horning it in. But, my question now, is how is this person pushed form one place to another, keeping in mind this theme of the spirit of silence? Locked in his own thoughts and memories and anxieties, how is he somehow ending up in this room? If he decides he must go there, that’s one thing, but I pictured this initially as something with a great amount of anxiety around it. I think I’d like to sacrifice the fantastical parts for now, kill my darlings, And start with

# Brainstorm

5/30/21

rereading the draft from earlier this month, definitely is a much stronger attempt at the idea, and I like what It's trying to do, it jsut needs to be a little more clear and concise, less of a rmable, even though rambling is part of it. It's like following a train of thought that keeps trying to divert, steering away from an inevitable conclusion, but it can't avoid it. THere's definitely a struture that can orient the thoguhts. There's lots of themes going on, between the dilation of time that we get from the sweeping stream of conciousness, hopefully a sense of musicality, becaues what is it really? It's like a snapshot of my head moving form my dad's diagnosis to revisiting the place my mom died. It's not the big odyssey i'd imagined before.

It's just a story about grief, loss, through the lens of the auditory, music and silence. I think I can thread together all of my meaningful or most poignant thoughts. I can spend some time re constructuing this story into somethign more cogent. As if someone asked me to write about my greif and morning, and its relation to music and silence. THis one in a lot of ways might be the most abstract in style, the least of a plot with characters and action. BUt, it's also going to be real as fuck. So still worth it.

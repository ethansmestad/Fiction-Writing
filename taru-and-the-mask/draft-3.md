## A Thesis Paper by Oliver Kerrigan

The story of academia, along with every other artifact of human civilization, is a story of families, which is to say parents and children; Functional or Dysfunctional is just a matter of perspective. For example, the Thesis format is itself an artifact, a tradition, a rite of passage that places initiates into a canon, a world that through repetition throughout time has earned itself some transcendent authority in the eyes of the living who honor it. 

_Abstract: Disillusioned son of canceled Harvard philosopher abandons academic career; submits memoir in place of thesis; presents myth of dubious origin which serves as allegory for modern intergenerational conflict and trauma._

For example, it'd be fairly common to begin a paper with a quote of some authority of the field, some little snippet or axiom that it would then be my labor to reinforce, reinterpret, criticize, expand upon, and in some way react to it. To not quote relevant sources is a cardinal sin of academia. ~~\(Quote about quoting sources in academic papers~~\) 

In the course of my studies, my aim has been to understand the dynamics of the intergenerational struggle seizing the world today, and ideally recommend solutions. My research has lead me through rabbit holes of History, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, Philosophy, Philology, Critical Theory; a cocktail of every single soft science we call The Humanities. 

The point of a Thesis is to articulate the findings of study and research. My study and research has spanned History, Sociology, Anthropology, Archaeology, Philology, Psychology, Philosophy, Critical Theory, Cultural Studies... ~~If my liberal arts education was a kind of cocktail, it'd be a Long Island Iced Tea Fishbowl. And I am sick from it, ready to purge it all onto a page for you.~~

Despite years of study and a lifetime lived in the Ivory Tower, I still watched as this battle between Boomers and Millennials carried on around me with no discernible progress or reconciliation. No matter what pet theory I formed, none of it ever proved actionable. It was only in the last month that I discovered an under-discussed piece of epic poetry, which the earliest Alexandrian scribes often attribute to the fabled Atlantis. Regardless of the definitive source of the text, the work, as I have interpreted it, has given me the insight I'd so desperately been seeking. Without it, I'd likely have written nothing. 

Here's my Thesis: Everyone wants to me to say something about my dad. They either want me to defend him, or disavow him. My future career in any university was dependent on this choice. _Was_, because after submitting this whatever-it-is to the thesis board, to my blog, to everyone in my life who has been waiting to see this-- I'll be withdrawing from my studies and abandoning academia, to do I know not what.

There's a few things I need to address straight out: Many people have been waiting to hear me speak my mind regarding my father, Dr. John Kerrigan. They want to know whether I stand behind him, or disavow and condemn him. I will address that. The fate of my career as an academic was dependent on my answer. _Was_, because with the submission of this paper, I've also since withdrawn from my master's program. It's hard to describe the sense of freedom this has given me, but I hope to make the reader understand over the course of this paper.

This isn't to say I haven't learned anything, or don't have scholarly things to say. What it means is I no longer have to make this Thesis paper anything other than exactly what I want it to be, and the sense of freedom that has come from that, along with other things lately, things i'm feeling for the first time in my life. I have to say, there's nothing like it, and I"ll be talking about it as well as I can here. 

----------------

I still find abstracts helpful, or TL;DR in modern parlance. So here's mine: In my studies and in my life, I've watched my generation abruptly awake from the dream of history into the nightmare of its lived reality. All role models and idols have proven false. Our reaction has been to dismantle all the systems and traditions passed down to us. We refuse to willingly repeat the sins of the past. Yet that's left us with no guidance for the future. In my generally fruitless studies, I did recover one obscure fragment of a myth ascribed by Alexandrian scholars to the fabled Atlantis.  Whatever the truh of this source is, I present the story here as a story that provides a parable about this war between generations and provides some insight to the youth of any generation trying to make sense of the history they ahve inherited. I know it's helped me find the freedom I feel now.

I'll begin with saying that the only reason I got into a Graduate History Program at Harvard is because my father, John Kerrigan, is who he is. I was born in the academic world, most likely conceived in it, by my father and mother, who was his TA at the time. It was only in the most recent months of reconsidering and retracing my whole life that I was able to realize the timing of my birth and my parent's wedding, and the fact that I was an accident that forced two people's lives together that, as we know now, didn't belong together. Again, even the shady timing of my parents quick marriage and my birth soon after is probably not news to you. 

## A Personal History

Still, I was born and raised in a large place where my father seemed king of the Castle. I have early memories of him reading the tales and stories of King Arthur, and the next day, he would take me around campus on his shoulders, and to see the way everyone greeted him, I was convinced he was King Arthur, and Harvard was his Camelot. 

Here I'm going to talk about my life being John Kerrigan's son.  Up until in my research, I discover this old myth:

One of the many other things I've realized in retrospect is that my father's bedtime stories, which was basically the only time I saw him consistently most nights of my childhood, were methods of subtle evangelizing. As I understood it then, he knew everything about the world. I grew up hearing at least 30 versions of the Creation story, from all over the world, in every different niche, and when I grew up asking him which one was true, he would ask me, 'why not all of them?' and I'd say, 'because they don't make sense together,' and then he'd say, 'How odd! Maybe one day, you can solve the mystery, and then tell me!'

## "Taru & The Mask"

He was grooming me to be a philosopher, same as him. You all already know his work, and why it mattered, but what was interesting growing up in the house with him was seeing him react to the world changing first-hand. By the time I was entering college, the first Occupy Wall Street had just taken place, and he was down there to converse with organizers and Michael Moore and Cornel West and Slavoj Zizek, and there are famous photos of them all together planning the revolution.

This is where I will share my verse translation of this old epic. 

Often, I remember him putting down a journal, listening to the radio, rubbing his face gravely, holding his chin like a good philosopher does, and sayign something like, "the leftist movement in America is being stolen. They're splitting it up into politics of identity, instead of uniting around class consciousness."

## Conclusion

I went into classrooms in college and heard the early conversations among my generation that were being had, about racism and sexism and xenophobia and bigotry, and I parroted my dad's thoughts, with a mix of self-importance, superiority, and at the same time a tremendous pity that they didn't know what I knew, so that it was my job to remind them that the real focus was class warfare, and not these petty fights over race and sex and identity. I quickly found myself demonized in these conversations and written off as a white supremacist, and once someone has pegged you for a white supremacist, most people don't rescind their opinions. I thought the revolution was doomed if these ignorant people would exclude me based on the color of the my skin.

This is where I'll offer my conclusion about what Taru's story tells me about thigns going on in the world, my own life.

I shared my frustrations with my father and he agreed, and he became even more adamant in his outspoken views against the wrong way in which things were going. I watched him come home angrier and angrier every day, claiming that free speech was dying, fascism was slipping deeper into the minds of children every day, and free-thinking critics were being silenced, careers ruined left and right, and he assured us that they were coming for him too.

What troubled me was seeing that my mother and my two younger siblings, Cara and Michael, didn't feel bad for him. Mom seemed not to love him anymore, and while I'd never heard them shout at each other growing up, they started shouting and fighting regularly.

I started to hear rumors. They were out and about around campus, and I only found out when I walked in on a conversation that shut down as soon as I walked in, everyone knowing I was his son. I finally got someone to spill the beans and tell me what was going on, and my friend told me some things that were being said.

Of course I knew immediately that there was already an ongoing effort to displace my father from his platform, and a scandal as was alleged would be the perfect way to cancel him and ruin his career. But, I decided to browse the internet and see what acutally came up about, because it was so hard for anyone to tell me straight to my face. 

I read things that made me doubt, both the accusuers, but the itng that made me doubt him was RateMyProfessor.

During the fall of senior year, Mom told us she was moving out. Michael & Cara wanted to go with her.  Everyone already knew how the lines were drawn. 

The divorce proceeding was long and belabored. Things were fraying within my family drastically. It was during these trying times where my faith in most things was waning. The deeper I read into the human history, the less pleasant it became. One thing that came a lot among the Greek literature was this reverece for a golden age filled with better people, long before. That even back then, even thought this world is largely builton worship of what the Greeks did, they themselves felt like paltry, terrible copies of some original and better progentiors with a magnificent world, a nostalgia for things they'vee never known. If foreward only spelt doom, the only way to go was further and further back into the past. It was at this point, thumbing through an obscure book on a









## Taru & The Mask

Taru was the beautiful young son of the king, Todoton. Todoton was the king of Atlantis, and a benevolent steward of the Land of Lemuria, in the lands to the south.

 Todoton was known by all as the mightiest of warriors, the wisest of leaders, the most good-natured, and benevolent of all kings. His deeds were known far and wide, and told by the people on almost every occasion, including the seasonal festivals.

 In the winter, the people told tales of Todoton’s birth, and how the mages read the stars and foresaw that this son of the king Telleron would be a great king, a savior of the land, and all the kingdom celebrated his birth and arrival. In the fall, during the harvest, the people told each other the story of when Atlantis was attacked by Yorunda, the great winged serpent, who destroyed the city, plundered its riches, and took the princess Bellana captive. Todoton received the Mask, which had been with the people since the first King Patyron, given to him by the Gods. Wearing the mask, he dared through the treacherous swamps, sailed across the treacherous seas, fought through a storm of fire, and finally deep into the poisonous caves where Yorunda dwealt with his stolen treasures. There, King Telleron slayed Yorunda, retrieved princess Bellana, and returned to the city a hero.

 This was only the first of many chronicles of Todoton’s greatness. He fought the mad King of Lemuria in single combat, and ended the war between at Atlantis and Lemuria, and sailed the world to foreign and distant lands, winning friends, victories, and spoils. Many Atlanteans believed Todoton would not die a mortal death, but would at the appointed hour, be called up into the heavens to join the ranks of the Gods, and that this was the destiny of all the kings of Atlantis who lived up to the legacy of their fathers.

 Taru dreamed of nothing but to join his ancestors among the realm of the Gods, and spent every day of his youth training in swords and words, strategies of battles, wise words from the centuries of scribes and counselors on all matters of ruling, and consulted with the mages on their arts.

 In all this time, Taru had never seen his father’s face. It was custom, when the heir to the throne came of age, that he would wear the Mask, called Tanathon, which would make him King of Atlantis and all that the sun touched. Todoton would finish a meeting of the council, and passing his son, would say, “Soon, your time will come to wear the mask, and I will go to join our ancestors.”

 When the day finally arrived, Taru’s heart beat mightily in his chest, and his father, Todoton, came to tell him it was time.

 They went deep beneath the palace, into sacred chambers no one else but the rulers of Atlantis ever entered. The ceremony was conducted in the dark, because when the mask was passed from one ruler to the next, the successor must never see his father’s face.

 Taru, overcome with curiosity, looked as his father took the mask from his face, and what he saw shocked him.

 His father’s face was ugly and evil. It told of horrible things, and as if his whole face was a confession, he saw that his father’s life was not what everyone has been lead to believe. In his face, he saw what happened the day Todoton went through the same ritual with his father: how Todoton saw the same evil and ugliness, and murdered his father right there in the secret chamber, as his father had done before. He saw that Todoton had sought out Yorandur himself, and promised he would not stop the serpent from seiging the city, knowing that to take revenge would bring him glory. He saw that on his journey toward the monster’s lair, he slew many innocents, used his people as playthings and puppets. He saw that he did not fight Yorandur bravely, but poisoned the beast in its sleep. He saw that Bellana, Taru’s mother, had been taken by force, that her whole life at Todoton’s side was as much a prison and capture as Yorandur’s lair had supposedly been.

 Faint of heart, Taru fell to the floor, crawling away from his father. Todoton spoke: “Now you see, Taru, the place of all the kings and the ancestors. When we allow the magic of Tanathon over us, we do what we must for Atlantis to live.”

 “I am reviled by the sight of you, father,” Taru cried, “and I want to end you with everything within me.”

 “As you must,” Todoton returned solemnly, through his grimacing face. “As I have done to my father, and his before him. This is the way that Atlantis stays peaceful and prosperous.”

 “I would rather die myself than become what you have become,” Taru cried.

 “In a sense, you will die when you are crowned by Tanathos. If you do not, then all the kingdom will fall, and all will be for nought, ruin, and doom endless and for all time.”

 In despair, Taru fled the ancient chamber, out the palace, hiding through the streets of his people and out beyond the walls, until he found the quiet of the wood.

 In solitude, Taru paced the grove and contemplated his situation. “Oh, my father,” he cried, “All my happiness was rested upon a falsehood. All the good rested upon an evil. Is there no good in this world that does not have an evil at its root?”

 “I will stop this evil. I will go to the people, and I will give them truth!” And without a further thought, Taru returned to city, greeted by people who knew him as prince, and followed him as he lead them to the place form which the ruler speaks to the people.

 From that place, he told them the truth of the rulers: the evil, the lies that supported every good. Having told the people the truth of their rulers, they fell into despair just as he had. Brother turned against brother. With no noble thing to believe in, they fell into evil ways, seeing no reason not to, and before his eyes, the city fell apart. Todoton emerged from the chamber to see Atlantis in turmoil, still wearing Todoton, and cried, “O, my son, you have ended everything! For your insolence, there shall be no more future, but only doom!” And with that, Todoton slew himself. Amidst the havoc, Taru took the mask from his father’s face and once more fled the city.

 Out in the wilds, he once more cursed the mask, saying to it, “It is you! You who have ended everything! You came from the Gods to make slaves of its kings, to condemn them to evil lives, and because I would not play your game, you have ruined everything!”

 Then, Tanathos, the mask, spoke with a voice made of thousands.

 “Taru, you do not yet see the truth of things. Place me over your face, see through my eyes, see all that I have seen, then you will know.”

 Taru wanted in that instant to disobey, destroy the mask once and for all, but curiosity came over him, and he placed Tanathos over his own face.

 Through Tanathos’s eyes, he looked into the face of the first of his line, Gondell. Then, he saw through Gondell’s eyes, as he slew the chieftain, and proclaimed this is where Atlantis would be built. He heard Gondell’s contemplations on the prosperity Tanathos promised him would come, and the prices that would be paid. Many men he enslaved to build his city, and many men died before the city was done. Generations of men who had began as his brothers, over the time, their children only knew themselves to be slaves, he the master, his son the next master. And the time came when the city needed more supplies, and he set out with warriors and took from many innocents. And the task was passedon to his son, telemon, and when Gondell took off the mask, his son saw his ugliness and slew him, ashamed. The mask now went onto Telemon’s face, who carried the shame, and continued the work.

 Taru watched the many, many lives of his ancestors, lived them as his own, and saw the sins of the father visited upon the children, and each time, the children fought to repent for the father, to pay the debt to their people, to improve things, and every time a price was paid. After several generations, it was understood that is was the mask, Tanathos, that held Atlantis together, and held the chain of generations, that this was the price of all kings, the way it was for the Son of Atlantis, so long as there would be an Atlantis

 Taru realized that all his life when he thought of the Ancestors, he thought only of the glory of Tanathos, the mask, the idol that promised greatness. Seeing through his ancestor’s eyes, the difference between him and then had disappeared. One spirit moved from generation to generation. All his ancestors lived on in him now. All their victories and glories, and all of their crimes and regrets, their hopes that a son might come one day to redeem them, to give them a second chance, to fix their mistakes, to repent, wash clean their sins. Taru was all the kings, everyone who he’d ever been taught to live up to, now reduced to children just like himself, caught in a trap. One person, repeating a life over and over, hoping to make things better the next time around.

 Taru ripped Tanathos from his face, knowing perfectly well who he was, and shattered the mask upon a rock.

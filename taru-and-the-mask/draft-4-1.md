# Draft 4

## Introduction

I've been asked by many people in my life to make a statement regarding my father, John Kerrigan. They want to know if I defend him or condemn him. At the same time, I've been working to finish my thesis for my graduate studies. While I'd like to treat these two issues separately, I have been unable to disentangle them. 

For the past two years, I've been engaged in an Individualized Study program. My coursework has spanned all the canonical texts across the many specializations under the umbrella of Humanities: History, Literature, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, Economics, as well as Critical Theory. 

It's the goal of all students to engage with the past in order to make a connection to the present they live in. Success in this goal is not a guarantee.

In my own life, I've watched the fabric of society alter fundamentally several times over since I was a child.  My generation grew up with the internet, and watched phones become an essential device to participate in almost all aspects of society. I have watched the evolution of social media, which has permanently altered the brain chemistry of billions of people. I have seen horrors and travesties turned into memes, and watched as all of human history has been critically re-evaluted, revealed as a horrible and endless bloodbath. I have watched what feels like the Last Judgement with everyone playing Judge, Jury, Executioner, and God all at once.

One angle I've found myself returning to over and over again has been this relationship between generations. Joseph Campbell's work in articulating the psycho-social functions of mythology has acted like a rosary for me. A major point of Campbell's work is that myths of a given tribe or community serve as vehicles of ritual and tradition, meant to psychologically initiate the youth of the community into that community. Often, these rituals also are used to help youth make the transition form childhood to adulthood, and signal a shift in the sense of self, along with the new responsibilities that come with it. These myths and traditions are the thread of integrity that allows for a culture's survival. I observe this phenomena everywhere around me.

What I have struggled to find is how this mythic function is still operating in a globalized society that is carrying with it all the seeds of our collective pasts, and is now engaged in a darwinian, evolutionary struggle to see which cultures and traditions will go on, which will fade away and die, and which will be stomped out of existence. 

Trying to make sense of all this has been the furthest thing from an abstraction. The fate of my career, the direction of my whole life, has been made contingent on whether I avow loyalty to my generation, my friends and peers and comrades, or to my father. 

I wrote at least ten drafts of a thesis that attempted to arrive at a holistic narrative regarding this current struggle between generations, how to understand it, and I was only falling further and further into suicidal ideation, because I could not make sense of the world, and what was the right thing to do, and it seemed no matter what, there was no future for me, or for any of the youth of this world.

I will say by God's Grace, because that is how it felt, I came upon mention of a myth in a footnote. A stanza in Latin was quoted, "_The faces of the Father & the Son / are masks hiding the Face of God."_

The line caught me, and I began a search for the source material. The Latin was attributed from a Dutch Scholar, Van Der Brooke, in the 15th century. Searching through everything related to his work, I discovered reference to a whole trove of Arabic works he had translated, which lead to finding the work Afuz Bin-Salman, a 10th century Persian Scholar, who found the work among Greek scrolls dated back to 400 BC, attributed to Heroclonus, a scholar who had worked for a time in Alexandria. His version of the work was thought to be the transcription delivered by an orator who came from Assyria, and said it had been passed down through countless generations. While many of the place names in the myth have totally butchered etymology, many of these early scribes speculate that it belongs to the same famous and ancient culture of Atlantis.

For a month, when I should have been articulating a draft of my thesis for my advisors, I locked myself in the library and combed and consulted every available source, moving between all the different translations of the stories, placing together the fragments, and making sense of something that called deep within me, something that felt like it needed to be known. 

Once I had an english translation rendered for myself, it felt as if I was hearing my own echo, first uttered by me thousands of years ago and many generations since. It was a story told just for me, and ultimately, the story is now my own.

I have translated it as "_Taru & The Mask._" I will present my verse translation below, because I believe this story saved my life, allowed me to make sense for myself of many things, and I hope in sharing the piece, along wiht my analysis, I can fully answer the question people are most interested in. 

## The Golden Age

We enter the world already immersed in a tradition. As a Jew, a Muslim, a Christian, a white American, a black American, An Indian. More than likely, a complimentary view of the world and the people who brought you into it 

## Shame

\(_The revelation of shame. Discovery of the internet, all idols are fallen. Understanding of the world is called into question. Personal memoir: going to college, growing family tension, thigns going bad with dad, career going down, friends organizing against him, calling him out, the whole struggle of understanding the world isn't what we thought and how youth typically react. Longer part, most detail.\)_

## Taru & The Mask

\(_DIscovery of the tale, a bit of the history of scholarship, then the whole thing presented in whole.\)_

## _Conclusion_

\(_Final articulation/ analysis of the themes in the story, how it pertains to the millennial situation, how it pertains to his life.\)_

# Draft 4

## Introduction

I've been asked by many people in my life to make a statement regarding my father, John Kerrigan. They want to know if I defend him or condemn him, and in a world of soundbites, I realize that even if I attempt to do both, it won't be received so holistically. At the same time, I've been working on my thesis for my graduate degree. For the past two years, I've been engaged in an Individualized Study program, geared toward the humanities. _\(study of humanities, geared toward understanding Millennial generational consciousness, and how this issue also pertains very personally.\)_

## The Golden Age

\(_Extrapolation/interpolation of the phenomena of growing up, psychic structure of childhoos, the whoel set up, and the memoir of early life lived with Dad, things are good the world is good.\)_

## Shame

\(_The revelation of shame. Discovery of the internet, all idols are fallen. Understanding of the world is called into question. Personal memoir: going to college, growing family tension, thigns going bad with dad, career going down, friends organizing against him, calling him out, the whole struggle of understanding the world isn't what we thought and how youth typically react. Longer part, most detail.\)_

## Taru & The Mask

\(_DIscovery of the tale, a bit of the history of scholarship, then the whole thing presented in whole.\)_

## _Conclusion_

\(_Final articulation/ analysis of the themes in the story, how it pertains to the millennial situation, how it pertains to his life.\)_

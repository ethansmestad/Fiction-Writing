# Draft

I've been asked to say in some public form where I stand regarding my father, John Kerrigan. People want to know whether I defend him or condemn him, as if those were the only two options. 

At the same time this has been asked of me, I've been working this past spring on finishing up my thesis. The subject of my thesis is what I've termed the Generational Drama. The Generational Drama is a framework I've developed for analyzing and understanding the why societies, cultures, and politics are shaped and evolved by the dynamics embodied between parents and children; families, more broadly. My study has borrowed heavily from Joseph Campbell's work.

My thesis work and my personal dilemma are directly related. Everything I've been studying has been an attempt to make sense of the predicament I find myself in. Until very recently, I'd felt I failed. By a turn of fate, my research led me to an obscure and under-studied myth whose origins are still disputed. Regardless, I feel its contents have saved my life, and finally allowed me to articulate a way to understand my own situation, and I believe speak to a larger situation the world has been struggling with. 

The statement that's being asked of me will have consequences on the trajectory of my career, and my life at large. Given the severity, I'm taking the liberty to explain my situation as thoroughly as possible.

The Generational Drama is a pattern with a few variations, but a few core elements I've broken up into acts. It begins with the perspective of the archetypal child, and I call it the Golden Age.

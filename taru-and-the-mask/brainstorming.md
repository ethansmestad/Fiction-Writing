# Brainstorming

Notes for 2nd draft:

1. Thesis paper: be clear and academic in language, even if it's going to get really personal.
2. Narrative is an interweaving of the recovered myth, and the personal life anecdotes and narrative that align with it. Maybe evasive at first.
3. Try using this redaction/slashing method. Might help to the theme of the story, it's situation as an academic paper, all the things the narrator wants to say, but then feels like he can't say. 
4. We can talk about a lot of things in this 'paper' really, there's an analysis of cancel culture, restorative justice, social justice, revolutionary sentiment. All the schisms happening in society particularly along generational lines. Censorship, free speech, the evolution of ideologies. IT'll be helpful for it read a little high-falutan and like someone who's spent too much time in universities with the lingo, especially as it applies to very visceral real situations,

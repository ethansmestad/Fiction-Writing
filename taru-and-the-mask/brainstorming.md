# Brainstorming

Notes for 2nd draft:

1. Thesis paper: be clear and academic in language, even if it's going to get really personal.
2. Narrative is an interweaving of the recovered myth, and the personal life anecdotes and narrative that align with it. Maybe evasive at first.
3. Try using this redaction/slashing method. Might help to the theme of the story, it's situation as an academic paper, all the things the narrator wants to say, but then feels like he can't say. 
4. We can talk about a lot of things in this 'paper' really, there's an analysis of cancel culture, restorative justice, social justice, revolutionary sentiment. All the schisms happening in society particularly along generational lines. Censorship, free speech, the evolution of ideologies. IT'll be helpful for it read a little high-falutan and like someone who's spent too much time in universities with the lingo, especially as it applies to very visceral real situations, 

6/18/21 -- Totally lost all my guidance of the outline I came up with fors the story, but let me try to rewrite it here:



The story is framed as a Thesis paper by Oliver Kerrigan, which is supposed to be for his individualized study program to say declare declare his research project, adn what was it?  A sociological study of the generational conflict between baby-boomers and millenials. Not quite, doesn't feel write. He was doing some kind of vaguely academic research composed of history, sociology, psychology, critical theory, philosophy, anthropology, like if a liberal arts graduate degree were a cocktail, it'd be a LOng Island Iced Tea. That should be part of it form the beginning, is that he's been doing this totaly in articualte hodgepodge of research over the last two years and is supposed to make, well a thesis out of his research, and he was probably already kind of a wreck in trying to synthesize this work together. But it has to start with at least acknowledging his position, trying to speak about it academic lingo, like "The place of contemporary graduate student is a site of itnersectional soceital neuroses that has bred countless societal issues. And that's crossed out. But I don't want it to be too unclear.

I want this to be larger in scope now, because that's my jam, I like grandiose things. This is a story in which to talk about not simply the contemporary struggle of generations and human history, but specifically through the lens of academia, which we see as being in a major crisis. I had a more concrete thought about this angle of academia, but we'll see if I can recover it in brain storming here.

We start just like any thesis would start, talking about the background of the research, and enticing us by telling us what's going to happen in the paper. He's going to be writing a memoir interwoven with his research and speculation. He's going to basically be providing a memoir that is balanced against academic language that keeps parts of his own life at a distance form himself. He's going to describe his life with his father, watching the various threads of the world evolve, finally leading up to the culture war, the disgrace of his father, and leading up to this point where his own future is dependant on either publicly disavowing his father, or what? At Which point in his research he discovers this ancient myth and loses himself in translating it and presentign it for the reader. He then provides some summary and analysis, maybe a little bit of extra information, sicne throughout he is acknowledging the audience personally: the thesis committee, his fellow peers at school, family and friends, and ultimately his ather. He makes his thesis about the spiritual understanding of belonging to history and conducting a relationship with generations, the need to identify with and own all of it, what it means to step into your own life, and that all any of us owe is to do what we can to extend a chance to seven generations from now. It will be a very compelling essay, and it ends with him handing it in and withdrawing from school and academia, which he also takes the itme to say is vitally important, but probably going through swan song of sorts, and what replaces it is up to us to decide, and we just have to know that we will make mistakes and our children will pay for it, and we can only do our best not to. All we can do is make sure we give our future selves a chance to pass it along. 

We've got this story developing of a famous academic who's getting canceled, and his son who's in struggle between holding up what his dad represents, everything he cherishes, everything he seeks to inherit, stands to inherit, even though he's now aware of the great evil its founded upon, and the fact that it's crumbling anyway--or is it? I think it is, but maybe that's part of the argument to be made. So This kid, Oliver we'll call him, has been doing this individualized study for his Masters of Arts, and he was probably working towards being some kind of scholar generally, something in the field of theory and humanities, but I think he's been woefully disillusioned like many of us have, without a real sense of what to do. But he's going through college watching his father's reputation go down the drain, trying to make sense of the things happening in the world, the movements, trying to analyze the shifts between generations, so maybe he's doing some kind of anthropology, sociology, probably most likely sociology about the specificities of the current changes in culture, as well as the way it situates itself in a lot of other contexts. I think it's the kind of thing where this guy is raised in the academy, he knows the lingo and is pretty well-read, but maybe part of what he's gone through recently is realizing that a lot of the things he was raised on by his father are now considered bogus. So slowly throughout school, even somewhat outside of his assigned work, he's been re-educating himself with the new material, the different classes. He's probably got to go outside his normal circle of peers to acutally hear the things he needs to hear and engage with the conversations. On an imaginary version of Harvard's campus, there's all this social and generational turmoil going on, and he's got somewhat of a privileged seat, even though his father's career is getting cancelled, and Oliver is probably just trying to keep out of sight as much as possible, away form the world and buried in study, and writing his way out. 



Which is how he arrives where I've arrived at: first off, identifying the problem between generations in a more esoteric way, trying to speak to his own generation and the situation they're in. And it's that conclusion of how necessary it is to understand that the shames of the past have to be ours to own and inherit, and our ancestors, the people we put on pedestals for guidance, are really only earlier, more ignorant forms of ourselves. We must own all their successes and failures and crimes as our own to take responsibility for. And we must take our place in the chain, to do what our ancestors have always done: worked to give the next generation a chance. 

But we're talking about expanding the real world story a little more, building out the tumultuous situation. Right, and how does Oliver's conclusion lead him to dropping out of his degree, how does it lead him to deal with his father? He is probably facing criminal charges for statutory rape, no, he did some Louis type shit, where it's accusations of rape, and it is rape, but situations where he himself didn't think of it as rape, or disagrees with it. I think similar to the Louie situation where there's enough ambiguity that it's not criminal, but in today's world it's understood as unacceptable behavior, and one that doesn't allow for retribution at this point in time. 

I think in a certain way, the paper is something addressed to his father. It's addressed to the world and all his peers, but it's also addressed to "The Boomer" the one parent who the millenial sees as their enemy, the source of all problem and conflict, and all these older folks are now getting shamed and disgraced and justice doesn't seem clear and no one i happy with the revenge beign waged. I don't think Oliver will do any wholesale condemning of his father, jump on a bandwagon to avoid mob justice. I think he'll lay out his story and his argument to demonstrate that he thinks whatever his father has done is something he has to learn to live with as a part of himself, and something he has to take responsibility for. Maybe he'll start by going camping with his dad and talking.



Taru & The Mask -- The myth itself could use some symbolic clarity. The point of it for me is to illustrate the fact of tradition, how a way of life is passed from generation to generation, a systemic cycle, and how one learns about the truth of that cycle and is horrified, and we swear to be different than our parents, to do things right and change things, but in all of history no generation has avoided mustakes, or if they did things better, there was no way to keep their kids from doing the same thing. And the magic is Taru realizing he is not just Taru, but he is the living vessel ofhis ancestors, their hopes of redemption, and while they might want things from him, he will ultimately make his own choices. I think maybe I don't know what else I want this myth to be yet, but the current attempt on it makes enough sense. 



Story structure wise, it feels as though it probably won't be interspersed like I imagined. It'll be more like this autobiographical essay considering a whole bunch of different things, reaching his point of crisis. What is his point of crisis? I have to imagine it's something like people calling for him to publicly condemn his father, like even people on his thesis board, people who want to give him opportunities in academia, but need him to publicly distance hismefl from his father in order for these opportunities to open up. I just don't want this to be taken as some kind of white male defense of tradition. i want it to be clear if anything he's finally taken this authentic place in himself where he's not living in his father's shadow anymore, he's leaving the program because this was something his father always wanted for him, and it was something he thought he wanted for himself,  but I think he's breaking the mask in the same way that Taru does. It's a statement that says, "Yes, I'm going forward without a guidance, without a role model, and I don't know if there's a better way to assure a future for our children, but we've got to try something new.

It's like being all of the ancestors, that whole accumulation of the same thing happening over and over again, and it's about finally trying something new, doing so in an authentic way. 

It also brings in mind what it means to preserve and understand the past. Because education will always be important, but considering all the debates about critical race theory going on now, it's also relevant here. We all have to choose how we're going to tell the story, how honest we're going to be, how honest we can be about it. Because we don't want to destroy universities, we don't want to eliminate all education, but we do want to be honest about the fact that there are many serious problems with it that need fixing. It's part of a whole system of life around the world that needs a major overhaul. And we, the youth, have to do the work of assimilating our ancestors, becoming the ancestors, and only once form that understanding do we act. We no longer look to our own older selves as role models, because in this world, they are children just like us. We must go with all the power and glory, and all the shame and regret, and use every facet of ancestral memory, to move forward into a new world, with our north star only being to give a chance for the next generation, not to tell them to become us or live one life over and over again, ut just to live in such a way that seven generations from now they have a chance to make their own choice. The question of our survival or extinction, the buck always gets passed to the next batch, and the only thing that assures that survival is each generation receiving an understanding of why the game is worth playing, and how to play it such that we can keep it going and keep passing the ball. 

**So there's a lot going on here, and I think we're going to mainly visit it as like a thesis that's meant to be delivered as the sum of his work in grad school, addressed like any academic paper is, but at some point, Oliver acknowledges his audience: his mentors on his thesis board, his peers in school, his family, and finally his father. And he's talking about what he studied, by way of talking about his life, growing up what it was like, and then coming to the conflict emerging in the beginning of college, the crisis at home and in the world evolving, and these crises global and personal being reflected in the course of his studies, which he keeps mentioning more in the context about how it's affected him, and its half personal confession, half using himself as a case study and speaking for academically neutral about the essence of his own challenge, which should hopefully be a little funny. I think his character is something similar to Jared in Silicon Valley. And it this narrative arrives at the crisis of all his research and school work accumulating at the same time he's been asked to make some definitive statement about his father, about where he stands, what are his beliefs and are they acceptable to the audience? And it's at this point of immense pressure that he introduces his work translating the ancient Myth of Taru & The Mask. After relaying the story, he offers his thesis conclusion, his answer about understanding the connection of generations, an answer that is no answer, one that says first you have to konw this, then you don't have to know anything else. Then after delivering his Thesis and conclusion, it's announcing his withdrawal from the program, his admission that he's now someone without a path, and that his only north star is to somehow assure that the next generation gets a chance to keep passing the buck.**

# Brainstorm for Oliver's memoir

I have been asked to say wether I defend or condemn my father, John Kerrigan. At the same time, I've been struggling to work out the thesis for my graduate studies. These two things should be separate issues, but they're not, for two main reasons: First, whatever stance I take regarding my father will have consequences not only on my future career, but potentially the trajectory of my whole life; Second, and more importantly to me, the goal of my studies has been to find a way through this situation, which perfectly encapsulates a larger phenomena I've been studying, which I've been calling The Generational Tragedy.

Until very recently, I could not see a way out and beyond the GT,  and was contemplating ending my life. It was at that time I discovered an over-looked and under-studied myth. Its origins are dubious, but the trace of it leads back at least to the Assyrians, and has been speculated to originate in the fabled Atlantis. What's important about it is that it told a story that felt meant for me, just at this time in my life. Finding it was like hearing my own echo from across thousands of years and hundreds of generations. It's a story that has helped me find my voice, and it's my hope

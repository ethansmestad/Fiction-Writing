# Oliver's Memoir

Everyone already knows, and I just want to say for the record: the only reason I got into the Graduate School of History at Harvard is because of my father. It was effectively guaranteed no matter what I did. I have lived at Harvard, surrounded by its campus my entire life. A few of the people meant to review my thesis have known me since I was born.

My earliest memories of my father were his diligent and consistent lectures delivered at bedtime. He made a point of telling me every single creation story he came across, from every major civilization. By the time I was six years old, I had most of them memorized, and I'd developed a preference for the Native American ones that spoke of animals and mud on the back of turtles which were the most comforting images. The Egyptian ones with Osiris' phallus struck me as gross. At the time I could finally ask these questions, I related to my dad the sudden confusion at the fact that there so many versions of how the world was created, one of them had to be right and rest wrong. At which point he'd tell me the story of Charles Darwin and the modern sciences, and as even more mind-boggling those stories were, he always made the point of saying that these sciences explained things up to a point, but wouldn't make claims it couldn't prove and as it turned out, there was still many things It couldn't yet prove. And so, he got into the habit for a while of saying, "Think about it and get back to me when you figure out the answer to the mystery of life, I'm dying to know myself!" It was his version of a dad joke, which I got sick enough of that I stopped asking these questions for a while.

Of course all of this was part of his evangelizing to turn me into a philosopher like himself. He, the famous  Synthesizer, in a world of specialists who worked mainly to take things apart to study in isolation, he was the one who brought the threads of so many schools and disciplines back together, to use as a tool of holistic thought, a way of thinking that could be applied to ethics, economics, legal matters, political strategy, war, and his mind was sought after by business tycoons and politicians and generals and everyone interested in power.

I also remember him taking me on his shoulders around campus, all the people who smiled and waved at him, the whole sense of the school itself as a much larger family.

Often, my father was gone making the world a better place with his brilliant mind, and while I loved my mother, I took her for granted, like the air we breathe. Dad's return was the big event, the thing that made time with him special and precious. 

At every major event in my early life, Dad played some kind of role. When 9/11 happened, he was called to advise in think tanks and write articles to reflect on all the things at play to understand the situation fully, and how to best respond and act. When the war was declared, he protested and helped the students organize. I remember him speaking to my mother about this freshman senator from Illinois who's campaign he thought would be the perfect answer to Bush-era America. I was with him at Obama's inauguration, and we got to speak with the new president for several minutes, though I remember most when he took us out of the VIP area to walk on the streets with the people who'd flooded DC, to feel "the spirit of the people"

"This is where power resides," He said to me then as we wandered on a highway normally packed with traffic, shutdown for the sake of the wandering masses celebrating Hope & Change. "In the streets, with the people. This is where true power belongs, and nowhere else. A state is only as good as it ensures a situation like this prevail, and all the people can say, _we_ did this."

I know how much his way with words meant to so many people, only imagine what it was like when that was your father, and you have his DNA, and how are _you_ going to measure up to that?

Which is why there was no question I'd do anything other than what my father had done. 

I remember when Occupy Wall Street was happening, and he went down to convene and speak with the organizers, to speak with Michael Moore, Cornel West, Noam Chomsky,  Slavoj Zizek.

Often, I remember him putting down a journal, listening to the radio, rubbing his face gravely, holding his chin like a good philosopher does, and saying something like, "the leftist movement in America is being stolen. They're splitting it up into politics of identity, instead of uniting around class consciousness."

After being inevitably legacy'd into Harvard, I went into classrooms in college and heard the early conversations among my generation that were being had, about racism and sexism and xenophobia and bigotry, and I parroted my dad's thoughts, with a mix of self-importance, superiority, and at the same time a tremendous pity that they didn't know what I knew, so that it was my job to remind them that the real focus was class warfare, and not these petty fights over race and sex and identity. I quickly found myself demonized in these conversations and written off as a white supremacist, and once someone has pegged you for a white supremacist, most people don't rescind their opinions. I thought the revolution was doomed if these ignorant people would exclude me based on the color of the my skin.

I shared my frustrations with my father and he agreed, and he became even more adamant in his outspoken views against the wrong way in which things were going. I watched him come home angrier and angrier every day, claiming that free speech was dying, fascism was slipping deeper into the minds of children every day, and free-thinking critics were being silenced, careers ruined left and right, and he assured us that they were coming for him too.

What troubled me was seeing that my mother and my two younger siblings, Cara and Michael, didn't feel bad for him. Mom seemed not to love him anymore, and while I'd never heard them shout at each other growing up, they started shouting and fighting regularly.

I started to hear rumors. They were out and about around campus, and I only found out when I walked in on a conversation that shut down as soon as I walked in, everyone knowing I was his son. I finally got someone to spill the beans and tell me what was going on, and my friend told me some things that were being said.

Of course I knew immediately that there was already an ongoing effort to displace my father from his platform, and a scandal as was alleged would be the perfect way to cancel him and ruin his career. But, I decided to browse the internet and see what acutally came up about, because it was so hard for anyone to tell me straight to my face. 

I read things that made me doubt the accusuers, but the itng that made me doubt him was RateMyProfessor.

During the fall of senior year, Mom told us she was moving out. Michael & Cara wanted to go with her.  Everyone already knew how the lines were drawn. 

The divorce proceeding was long and elabored. Things were fraying within my family drastically. It was during these trying times where my faith in most things was waning. The deeper I read into the human history, the less pleasant it became. One thing that came a lot among the Greek literature was this reverece for a golden age filled with better people, long before. That even back then, even thought this world is largely builton worship of what the Greeks did, they themselves felt like paltry, terrible copies of some original and better progentiors with a magnificent world, a nostalgia for things they'vee never known. If foreward only spelt doom, the only way to go was further and further back into the past. It was at this point, thumbing through an obscure book on arcaheology related to geological records that I found reference to Taru & The Mask.

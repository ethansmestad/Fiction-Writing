# Draft 4

This was supposed to be my Graduate thesis. It still is, insofar as it's my report on the findings of my research and study over the last two years. At the same time, it's also a testimony on where I stand regarding my father, John Kerrigan, and an apology to explain my withdrawal from school, right at the finish line of graduation. This is also a memoir, a presentation and analysis of epic poetry, a confession, and ultimately a great Yawp. 

Working in the Bollingshire School of Individualized Study, I had the privilege of curating my very own unique program of research and study. In my time, I conducted a thorough and interdisciplinary survey of the canon of every specialized field that falls under the Humanities: Literature, Philosophy, Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology, History, Linguistics, Mythology, Critical Theory--and so on. I attempted to find a synthesis across all these specializations, to create a mental tool box containing just about every known tool of analysis. When my professors and advisors asked how I intended to articulate a definitive thesis based on this expansive & exhaustive program, I would mention something about theorizing a new form of pedagogy sensitive to the exponential evolution of the Information Age, but I had no idea what I even meant by that.

The trouble was that a thesis wasn't simply an argument to make over some academic trivia; it was a declaration of existential purpose, a piece of writing that would say to the world, "this is me."  Until very recently, I was lost in suicidal ideation. What saved me, and has lead to this writing, was the discovery of an obscure and over-looked myth. Part of its obscurity is due to the ambiguity of its origins. The feeling I had upon reading it the first time was that it was meant for me, like a message from myself, an echo of my own voice, thousands of years and hundreds of generations prior. I fell into a whole of research to parse out it's history and origins, which ended up beign no more of a loose colleciton of fragments, different versions of the story all being told around the mediterranean, witht he earliest fragments referencing the story as a folk tale attributed to Assryian orators, and the fragments captured by Alexandrian scribes. COnsulting every available translation and version fo the story, I took it upon myself to render my own translation in Epic verse. 

The story is about a prince named Taru, and his initiation into the ancient tradition of his royal family, and his ultimate decision to break with that tradition. 

It's because of this ancient story that I finally found a way to make sense not only of my studies, but of my life, and of the world, and the dilemma of generations.

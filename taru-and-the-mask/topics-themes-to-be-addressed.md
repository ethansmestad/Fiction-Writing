# Outline

There's an organization of thought necessary here since this is such a dense story with a lot going on. The main thing right now is figuring out the balance of personal narrative balanced with academic-y portions. The point of the academic portions is to make these little mini-assertions, a framework for understanding a given situation. There's probably some bullshit quote or citation. But then, there's the personal anecdote, or the memoir section, which is the real meat and potatoes. And structuring this in such a way that the story itself moves along in pace with all the points that need to be made.

## Youth are raised with a narrative that places them in a tradition and frames their values, usually where parental and ancestral figures are given idolized status, serving as role models.

1. Beginning of Taru & The Mask.
2. Bullshit academic stuff, Levi-Strauss, Campbell, Freud,
3. Oliver's early life narrative



## New Information calls traditions into doubt: Role Models are dethroned, youth rebels and vows antithesis. This itself is still part of the cycle of tradition and the doom of generational cycles

1. Conflict of Taru & The Mask
2. Bullshit academic stuff
3. Oliver's conflict in college, 



## Taru's path: Spiritual answer. Assimilate the ancestors, identify, bridge the divide, move forward into uncharted territory with new identity

1. Taru's revelation, his response, end of story
2. Academic interpretation
3. Personal relationship to thesis statement.

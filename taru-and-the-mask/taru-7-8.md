# Taru 7/8

1. Introduction: John Kerrigan is accused. Oliver must say where he stands. His academic studies have been an attempt to make sense of everything in his life and tell a story about it. Generational Drama
2. The Golden Age: Here is how the Golden Age functions. Here is what my early life was like.
3. The Fall: Here is what happens often, when we find out the world isn't acutally as it was given to us. Getting college, meeting Cassie, dad's first accusation, evolving friendship with Cassie, dad going alt right, confessing love to cassie and getting turned down, Dad is accused in a more robust way, getting canceled. Cassie is getting harrassed and attacked, nothign for her is easy and in no way is anyone like her in a position of power. Crisis.
4. Taru & The Mask.
5. The conclusion. Oliver is leaving academia to go off and try to build a better future with Cassie and their friends

# Draft 1 \(6/3/21\)

The world was saved on November 3rd, 2021, at 5:24 PM, in Central Park of New York City. Unless you were one of the lucky ones there when it happened, most people never found out that the world had already been saved, and are still running around fretting with anxiety over it. I hope they find this story to set them at ease. 

The world was saved by a Seventeen-year-old girl named Maya De La Cruz. She was a native New Yorker, born to 1st generation Nuorican parents in Ridgewood. On the day, November 3rd, Maya was losing a battle with a rare lymphoma. Ever since her diagnosis, a year earlier, she'd been dreaming a dream, a dream that took the shape of a performance, a play, that was performed at Bethesda Fountain. 

Maybe no one would've noticed the play if it happened on any other day. Probably, it would've been like every other performance that took place by that fountain: perfectly pleasant, a fond memory for whoever was passing by, but one among thousands of such performances in the history of that fountain on a lake in the center of the center of the world.

But because the play happened on that day, under just those circumstances, with all the forces of history, the convergence of every karmic destiny, every atom's path determined by classical laws of physics since the big bang, it happened to change everything forever.

November 3rd started at 12:00 AM, of course, and perhaps we could pinpoint the various threads that might anticipate the events of the early morning, but we won't attempt that here.

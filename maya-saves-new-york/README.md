# Maya Saves New York

6/19/21

—this story might still best represent my combined interests in storytelling in terms of character depth, emotional arcs and payoff, combined with heady ideas and fantastical happenings and grand sweeping scope. The question is, can I do in 60 pages max? SOmehow here's another one. and here's another

I believe so. The essence is a story about a single mother running for Mayor, her daughter dying of cancer, in the midst of a struggle for power and the many weighing questions about the future of humanity.

The challenge will be to take what’s essential if what I’ve built so far and get us to arrive in an understandable way. I imagined a lot going on at first, like the literal destruction of the city as all the forces of history bear down upon it at once, a little ludicrous but it’s for a ludicrous world. And the crux of it rests on Maya’s vision happening, a play that represents everything we loves and has learned in her short life, and her decision to make her death beautiful. Something with the quiet beauty of modest things, a ramshackle production that suggests more than it purely emulates, and yet.

Still in the scope of one tumultuous day, or where there’s an election happening that feels insignificant in the scope of an apocalypse, a death of the city that will inevitably bring about a new world. Yeah, I know it’s gonna be really good but it’ll take time and attention like anything good does.

I’ll probably have to give skim versions of all the other elements I wanted to shoehorn into it. All the histories, the family stories, the layers of history. Poor Maria. How is she going to find grace with her family all taken from her? I don’t know yet. It might be longer than 50 pages. I’ll probably cut a lot of what I imagined from the epic chase and shenanigans of everyone across the day. We can still start off with the situation in the morning, the mounting chaos throughout the day that’s a little outlandish but appropriate for the themes I’m going to articulate. Damn, this is going to be hard to get right, a lot is going to change, but I think I’ll get there if I see it through.

This is definitely a 3rd person omniscient but one where I won’t shy away from my own voice, espescially because I see myself saying all this like t actually happened:

“Most people didn’t realize the world had already been saved, but it happened on November 3rd, 2021, around 5:44pm in Central Park. The world was saved by a seventeen year old girl named Maya De La Cruz. She put on a play.”

Yeah, I can see myself taking the time I’m a day to do a first pass, though maybe it’s naïveté to think I can get it in one day, espescially when I need to start getting better at editing and rewriting.

But I do feel good knowing what’s essential to this story. The way history crashes down and convenes from all sides, screaming doom, peril, and death. I should be careful about what I actualize in the world, I did already cause a disaster at Notre Dame.

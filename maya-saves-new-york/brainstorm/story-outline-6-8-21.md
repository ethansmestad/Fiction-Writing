# Story Outline 6/8/21

## Prologue

"This is the story of how the world was saved once and for all. It happened on November 2ns, 2021, about 5:50 PM, at Bethesda Fountain in Central Park.

## Atlantis

Scene 1\) Jordan captures the scene at Battery Park. The police raid it. 

Scene 2\) Jordan makes his way to Sloan Kettering. We note the state of the city. We see things from Jordan's perspective

Scene 3\) The hospital. The call to action, the confrontation of Maya & Maria. We see things from Kendra's perspective.

## Tempest

Scene 1\) Overview of events across the city: Machinations in the upper echelons, the putterings of the disenfranchised, the various and many people all responding to the unfolding of the day in their unique ways

**Goal: Provide big picture abstraction, introduce the city as a singular body, make an effort to draw the body metaphor. New York as a crown on the whole Earth. That crown dissolving.** 

Scene 2\) Jordan & Kendra splitting to gather their cohorts, hashing out old beef, getting people on board, gathering resources.

**Theme: Being the younger generation, facing a bleak future, breaking through despair, uniting to do something incredible, out of pure love, that being the only thing that sees them through.**

Scene 3\) Maria trying to fight the powers, organize the people, ultimately failing, and finally deciding to go find Maya

 **Theme: Maria's whole life being a product of being the lowest and most forgotten among peoples, her whole life wanting to be in control, to save the earth, ultimately realizing she can't control it.**

Scene 4\) Maya & Eddie talk in the hospital. Power goes out. Prison Break, out into the streets

**Theme: Her and the city are one. Her whole life being the product of everything people have ever done. Arriving to this state. A mystical convergence of herself and all things. Still being terrified of death, tunnel vision over her own light at the end of the tunnel.**

Notes: These scenes will probably be more interspersed. A little less in depth with various aspects.

## Maya's Play

Scene 1\) The preamble of the kids assembling the production in the park, the various disillusioned wandering people deciding to help out. Maya arrives at the scene.

Scene 2\) Maria wanders her way to the park in a daze and watches the play of her daughter's death.

Scene 3\) The play never really ends, but turns into a party. Maya faints, and they rush back to the hospital.

# Brainstorm

5/25/21 --  The Question is  if I want to tell the novel version of Maya in a condensed form, or reconsider the whole scope of the story into something smaller. Because I've done so much work and world building, that I could theoretically word vomit a version of the story if I was telling it to someone, but knowing the form and structure would help immensely. I know I want to start as the writer addressing the reader about the fact that the world was actually already saved by this young woman, and how do I go about it? This could be a real invitiation for me to fall into some sweeping prose, the kind of prose that doesn't need structure because the story is so well known, you can almost think of it as an oral tale, like songs of old. 

However, there's lots of parts of the story that are probably extra, for example, the whole mid part of the day describing the various trials of everyone making everyhtign happen, making this play happen even as the city is going to pieces. The way it happens against all odds. The ways in which all of human history accumulate in a single day. It's a grand and epic story. But as I understand it, there was this play that the sick girl was workign on with her friends, a tumultuous produciton beset by a million obstacles, one that looked like it wouldn't happen, but one that comes to a head, where it must happen if this girl is to get the death she wants and deserves. 

And her mother, fighting to save the world herself, even as it spirals far beyond her control and she fights against being powerless, being a victim, learns how to not be victim. I think I can hint at all the things going on without having to dive into specifics, because it is a story of such sweeping scope. 

It's kindof a ridiculous story, but it's also one I know that does what I want, something that seems to contain everything.

But maybe the city literally crumbling apart is a little much for suspension of disbelief. I think We can imagine an election day that's chaotic and besmirched by the problems that we've already identified, crazy weather events, complete social upheaval, a war in the streets between the masses of working poor and the ultra rich barons, and in the middle of this skirmish, a band of children scrambling to put together an over-elaborate production reduced to rags. The silence that falls over the hushed masses. I can even see the really condensed version that leaves out a lot of the extra information, but still gets the point across. The action across the story, the trajectory, what makes it a story more than an image or a painting, is the characters trying to make something happen and facing doom at every corner. Certain doom. I don't want to offer false hope. Nothing can save Maya from her fate, which is what it comes down to. Nothing can save this world from collapsing. Maria is fighting to keep the city from falling apart, and she goes around doing her best to put bandaids on the gunshot wounds. Her daughter's friends are running around the city gathering friends and resources and supplies, trying to put on a play even as the city is hit by freak hurricanes in the middle of a war for control of the city. And the whole thing is trending downwards. The worst fears are coming true and being realized. Maria will lose the election, the billionaires will win and maintain their false order for another day. But similar to Island, everyone who saw that play will have something to carry them they didn't have before, hopefully the same thing everyone who read the story will have. The inner thing. The unspoken thing, that once the storm clears, and the next day comes, once death has visited,  they will have changed, everything will have changed. 

I think this can work the same way Notre Dame worked, all of the character's lives, all their place in history, all come together in a single day, a single moment. Yeah, I don't think some of the craziness form the fiirst brain storms will work though. I'm not afraid to be alittle over the top and dramatic, but I think there's also a way in which the craziness of the day can be believed as beign very close to home, close to reality. But I don't think Maria has a classic moment with a James Bond villain. Especially if I'm now gearing it towards imagining all the worst outcomes and defeats despite all the battles and struggles. What does that look like in her world? It looks like people out onthe streets, really ready for violence, to tear things down, the police and military getting ready to shoot people down. Then the storm breaks, which delays the battle, scatters it, and causes the whole situation to disperse into chaos. There's immediate government order for people to all get home, at the same time that there are mass arrests, and people sheltering from the storm, power going out, the storm clearing and the battle returning, and honestly i imagine most people giving up. I might not figure it out until I'm in the writing. But I think generally,  I'm going to be less "in" the scenes, not that I'm telling everything as exposition, but that it's that different more omniscient style. It's literally just me telling this story about something that happened, and everything and everyone involved in it, ever, all these thigns cumulating t oa play.

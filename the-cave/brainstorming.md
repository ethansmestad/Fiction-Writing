# Brainstorming

6/14/21 -- Mainly just want to revise the middle section explaining all the ideas. Then, I could even see a sadder conclusion to this story? Let it play out a little more, a few more scenes to give everyone agency. I do acutally like how everyone is characterized in this. If there were to be scenes, it'd be based on everyone wanting to know what Sophie decides to do. I think the sad thing would be her going into the graveyard to live a fake life, and what would keep Hori from wanting to join her. we coudl see more of hte fall out. something that affirms  hori's thesis, perhaps to painful effect. im not someone who's anti-vr though, im probably a fatalist more than anything. the goal for me here to entertain a remise and a possible world and how that might be for people, and i'd like to be ambiguous enough that tungs could go either way.

Well, why not imagine it? The company is going to move forward with its plan, unperturbed, despite resistance, because truthfully the world is in a fucked up place and everyone's already an addict, and the pitch will be convincing of everyone going into VR to save the planet and conserve energy, but this would take a while to happen wouldn't it? And what happens to them in the meatime? that's the one thing. THere'd have to be a convincing argument to spend all that free time just saying things float along until its ready. A lot of things could happen, I think HOri would spend a lot of time trying to get her to enjoy life, and it'd mean something to for him too. He'd probably go through this whole leave the company, run away with me Sophie, let's go be happy! And how would Uma react? Not as peacefully as we'd think. We think of her as a cool customer but she obviously cares about her daughter too. THe story oculd play out the tensions of reality and fantasy a little more, the tug of war. At the same time, the short little story does do an effective job of saying the core of what I want to say. We can leave the rest of this for workshop. It's fun to imagine the million different ways it might go from this point int he story, and I'm happy to have peopel wonder, btu unless enough people tell the story feels incomplete in this form, I'm happy for it to remain a question rather than being an answer. 





6/19/21 -- REVISION--

The intro might be a little dull? not gripping enough? Maybe we can lace intteresting or inciting details. Or just a way to make it SMACK a little more. See what peer review says. 

CLena up and tighten HOri's philosophical arugment on the virtues of reality over fantasy.

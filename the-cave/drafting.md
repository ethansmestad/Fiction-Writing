# Drafting

When the girl ran her hand through a brook, the water was as warm as her skin, so it felt like a soothing nothing.

Redwood forest stretched around and far above her, soaked in early light. Trees towered far above her, protecting, and their canopies were still but for a few birds and their greetings filling the heavens. The girl whistled back: up in pitch, like a question, then down quickly, meaning “come say hello!” And a finch swooped down to a mossy rock at her side.

She whistled again, offered a finger, and the finch flew to it. She offered the finch droplets of water still clinging to the tip of her finger, and she stroked the feathers on its head. The finch flew away after a few minutes, and the girl picked herself up to continue her journey.

There was a path through the forest that lead to a beach. As she walked along it, she touched the trees that were ancient and thriving, and she savored the fresh air. She noticed different living things, each unique plant, the mushrooms and the moss, the ants and the dragonflies, and she greeted each one in turn. This was her walk through town, where she knew all the locals, and she started to hum the song from Beauty and the Beast: “_Bon jour! Bon Jour, Bon Jour, Bon Jour!_” And even her gentle humming echoed up through the canopy and received a few chirps back.

She finally saw the ocean and the sheer drop off that lead down to the sandy beach, empty and quiet but for the rolling and crashing waves. Noon sunlight high above made the ocean sparkle. She felt every grain of sand massage the soles of her feet, just warm and not yet hot. The sun as well, unclouded, bathed her without being harsh or burning her skin.

First, she liked to sit at the shoreline and just be, watching the waves, hypnotized and timeless. Then, without premeditating it, she would pull off her light cotton dress and jump into the ocean, warm from a whole summer soaking light, but still brisk. Her heart pumped and her pulse danced as she floated and stretched on the rolling waves, dove and saw through the world beneath the waves, like through a green glass bottle, and the salt didn’t burn her eyes. She swam submerged for minutes, then ascended and drew the briny air into her lungs.

As the sun was a hand width over the ocean, everything pink and gold, she swam for the shore, let the same breeze dry her smooth skin, then carried her dress with her back into the forest. The setting sun turned the canopy orange, peach and plum.

With the last bit of sunlight tracing the sleepy forest, she made it back to her cabin, where a glowing fire was already flickering in her stained glass windows. She closed the door, and her tabby cat, Tabitha, her Australian shepherd, Klaus, and her axolotl, Judy, all watched her enter and greeted her as they customarily did. The cabin was filled with aroma: lavender, sage, rosemary and thyme. As the last light disappeared outside, the dancing fire in the hearth made it so she was never cold for even a second. She made tea, ate blueberry biscuits, fed her friends, and cozied up with a book of Poe's poetry, which she never finished because before she knew it, she was asleep. Dreamlessly, as if only a moment later, she and her friends all woke with the dawn.

This morning, she was cold and shivering. The goosebumps on her skin made her feel like a plucked goose, an angel stripped of their feathers. There was a dampness in the walls and the floor. She dug through her dresser to find all of her thickest clothes. Outside was a thick fog that blocked all the sunlight and dimmed everything to grey. This had never happened before.

 As she shuffled around to feed and care for her friends, she found she was sweating through her clothes, and tried to imagine how she might’ve caught a fever. She stripped off her clothes again and drew a bath, just hot enough that she could step in easily and be submerged in comfort. But as she sat there, her body was racked with shivering, and her stomach and head felt filled with fluid, and her heart was racing, and her cat Tabitha looked at her, and said, “Who’s got the Adrenaline?”

The girl woke up in a damp sweat, the hospital gown starchy, itchy, and clinging to her skin, her heart beating too fast, two gloved and masked people holding her down, a large needle sticking from her chest, and beyond the needle and down beyond her feet, two blurry but familiar faces. The girl screamed like a newborn who didn’t have words, and barely knew how to use her body. Then they put a mask with a tube over her face and nose, and the air made it too hard for her to panic, and while she didn’t sleep again, the consciousness remained fuzzy enough for her to observe the scene from a distance.

A hand held her damp, stringy hair, caressed her cheek, and the voice said, “It’s okay, now. You’re back, you’re home, you’re safe.”  
----------------

“We’d like to keep her overnight, to do some CAT scans.”

Hori Gunndrson ran a hand through his hair, and his wife, Uma, remained stoic with her arms crossed while Dr. Hernan made his request. 

Hori anticipated Dr. Hernan’s explanation: “You’re afraid she’s got brain damage?”

“I don’t know anything about the effects of this for sure. Some common threads have started to emerge from people recovering from a VR coma, but there’s also lots of variation. We need as much testing as possible, both for her and for all the other people like her falling to this.”

“Let’s schedule it for the future.” Uma commanded and did not ask. Hori turned to her.

“What do you mean? We want answers straight away, don’t we?”

“Sophie needs to rest at home. She’s been living a dream, and it won’t help her want to stay awake if we keep making it unpleasant for her.”

Hori saw the unquestionable sense and was happy her mind was sharper than his right now. He turned to Dr. Hernan. “She’s right. Assuming she’s lucid and stable, how soon before we can bring her home?”

“She could be lucid in less than an hour. If we can run a few basic tests to make sure things are basically in order, then she could leave in two or three hours.”

“In time for sunrise.” Hori rubbed his sagging eyes, saw the deep circles in Uma’s.

Dr. Hernan bit his pen, drew a breath and spoke his omen.

“I’ll just say it for the record. I absolutely understand you wanting Sophie to have a comforting re-entry to reality at home, but it’s against my medical advice. It’s a risk. She’s part of the beginning of a health crisis on par with opioids, and I anticipate much worse. These Temples have been on the market barely a year, and the long term effects of these comas on the brain aren’t well understood yet. Relapse rates remain high, as well as suicide rates. I don’t mean to be grim or fear mongering, I just want you to know what we’re dealing with these days.”

“We know perfectly well what we’re dealing with,” Uma said, making for the door to Sophie’s room. “We put Temple on the market.”

Sophie drank an apple juice box through a plastic straw, and it tasted mostly like water, sugar, and the aluminum lining of the box. Perhaps she imagined the aluminum flavor, but it didn’t matter because she was told she _must_ drink the whole thing to help her blood sugar levels.

Her parents were both typing away on their own tablets, wearing the goggles that presented them with a layer of data on top of reality. This was how life had been since Sophie was a small child. Her parents had always made a big formal to-do of quality and together time, a time of no screens or technology, but it often felt like another kind of board meeting with a definite cut-off point. Sometimes these meetings would the regular hours of dinner time, or a weekend outing, even a whole weekend camping, one time. But once the clock hit the appointed time, the tablets came out, the goggles went on, and while her parents did business, Sophie had nowhere else to go but her own private digital reality.

In the hospital, Sophie was asked to not engage with any screens, and to practice mindfulness: Paying attention to her body, and her breath, her own thoughts, and taking no drugs that would affect her state of mind. It meant paying attention to the misery of being in hospital bed with no distractions. It meant staring at her parents in their distractions, ones they'd gotten her addicted to, and would now force her to go through withdrawal from.

They spent the car ride home in an initial silence as they coasted up the highway,  each looking out their own window while the car drove itself. A few minutes into the ride, Hori asked, “Sophie, you want to have some pesto pasta when we get home?”

“I’m not hungry.”

“Well, that’s not going to last forever, so?”

“Yeah, that’s fine.” Now that the gates were somewhat open, Uma reminded her daughter:

“You don’t have to talk right now, we know you’ve had a hard time. But we’re going to need to talk soon.”

“Yeah, I know.”

“You know we’re not mad at you?” Hori chimed in, looking to Sophie.

“I know.”

“We’ll figure this out. You want to listen to any music?”

“Whatever you want.”

Hori inhaled through his nose.

“Is there anything we can do for you right now?” Uma asked with patience.

“Just quiet.”

“Okay.”

They arrived back at the house, greeted by security. When they walked through the door, Sophie made quickly for her room, and asked if she could have dinner in bed, which her parents would not refuse her. They didn't have to worry about leaving her alone in her room because they'd have multiple hidden cameras installed since she was born, so Sophie was accustomed to having no privacy. There was a time when Sophie was only 5 and she began to choke on a chicken nugget, and Hori had seen her choking on the monitor and was able to rush up and clear the chicken  from her throat. Ever since then, the need for the cameras was seen as justified in perpetuity. 

Sophie had no need to do anything indiscreet in physical space. All she needed to do was sit in her bed, on her phone, her tablet, her computer, an Oculus, and in the last few months, she looked to be sleeping most of the time she wasn’t at school. If Hori & Uma ever looked at Sophie's room monitors, they saw nothing except for the faint waxing and waning, pale-blue glow of the Temples lighting up her dark room for a moment: The Temples were the size of a googly-eye, placed on either side of the user’s temples, and streamed the massive amounts of data necessary to directly interface with someone’s prefrontal cortex in a non-invasive way.

 The Gunnddrson’s fully embraced what they saw as the inevitable tide of the future, a party that, the earlier you showed up for, the more of a chance you had to benefit from what would come.

As soon as Sophie ran up into her room, Uma and Hori were accosted with messages from board members and other friends in the company checking in. They sat in their real living room with their goggles, simultaneously in a virtual room with twelve other colleagues, and both also had another corner of their hub dedicated to the live feed of Sophie’s room, where she seemed to be  browsing her bookshelf for something to read, something they took as a great relief.

Caleb, their dear friend and CEO of DiViN-IT, started off the meeting:

“I think it goes without saying, but your opinions on how we move forward are going to have the most weight in this discussion.”  Caleb was the one who’d drawn up the blueprints and made the enthusiastic pitch to Hori & Uma five years ago. Uma could read in the little twitches of Caleb's eyes that he was wondering whether Uma & Hori found him responsible in some way for what happened to his goddaughter.

“Appreciated,” Uma said, “but you don’t need to baby us. Whatever choices we make with and about our own family should have no bearing on the direction of the company.”

Hori said nothing, though he was supposed to at that moment echo his agreement, but allowed his silence to count as consent for the moment. The other talking heads nodded, and the conversation shifted to a report by the CFO, Delilah.

"And again, we appreciate you guys making time for the meeting. There's a lot of big things on the horizon, and we want you two in it every step of the way."

"Thank you," Uma said, well-practiced in these performances.

“I’m happy to say the direction is only up. The merger with Alibaba sent the stock price way high, and still only trending up. However," Delilah looked at Hori, too afraid to meet Uma's eyes to say: "I don’t know if you two have considered this yet, but in the spirit of not patronizing you, I’ll be frank about some near realities to deal with. The press most likely already knows about what happened to your daughter, and once the story breaks, the stock is going to fall. Honestly, it will probably plummet, and stay low for a few weeks over panic. This is exactly the kind of story that the red-pill community has been dying for, which is definitely bad for us."

"Hence the meeting for damage control." Uma didn't miss a beat, and made clear she was only interested in solutions, not pandering.

Here Caleb jumped in again. “We need to figure out our position. We can do nothing, and everyone will keep making money, more people will jump to our platform, governments will mainly stay quiet as long as they get to buy into it.” Everyone waited for him to say more. “Uma, Hori. I don’t meant to put you on the spot, and while I understand if you don't want to answer, I think it’s important we all know: how _do_ you think we should move forward?”

Because the goggles captured every twitch of their eyes and broadcasted it into the virtual meeting, there was no way for Hori and Uma to communicate in any private or discreet way, which meant they were left in a game of appearing as a unified front, not knowing who would speak up. Hori remained silent to let Uma take the initiative, curious himself what she would say to their investors.

“I tend to be a fatalist,” she began. “Whether it was us that got to this first or not, it would’ve happened, eventually. And we were always going to have to face these problems as a global society. I think to a certain extent, this technology, what it does to the world, is somewhat out of our hands. We have power here, I won’t deny that. But my ethical belief is that we’re not a government, we don’t make laws, and it’s not our place to make decisions for people. Prohibition has proven a failure at every point in history. Regulations? Fine, as much as they can minimize harm, they should. But nothing will stop people from doing what they want to do.”

“So you don’t feel responsible?” This came from a board member with a german accent, whom the Gunndrson’s didn’t recognize. Here Hori was ready to rip into the accusing kraut, but Uma remained a perfect poker player.

“Certainly I do. I--we as a company, should feel responsible for delivering what people want. If people want solutions, then that’s a debate to be had.”

“I think this is partly where Martha gets to shine, and can share with us her pitch.” Cale directed the conversation to the young Korean woman with dyed pink hair, who even virtually seemed bursting with excitement to share her idea.

"Thanks, Cal, and again, thank you Hori & Uma for taking the time. I'm glad to hear you speak so clear-mindedly about the Temple, Uma, but I also don't think we can expect that average user and customer to be as enlightened in mindset about it, which means we need to address the things people are alleging as problems with the platform.

"The biggest accusation is that Temple creates addictive behavior, and people won't be able to control themselves, meaning these comas will become more and more common. Maybe some of you have considered this already, but most of the heaviest lobbying against Temple is coming from other major industries: if their consumer base is literally living most of their lives digitally, then where's the market for most consumer goods?

"And the fact that we've made an enemy of 60% of the global economy is exactly what we spin in our favor. All of the environmental issues, the depletion of resources, the daily pollution caused by human activity-- The Temple presents a new life-style that drastically reduces human carbon emissions. If we hit 1 billion active and semi-active users, we estimate we could destroy the Paris Climate Accords 10, 15 years ahead of schedule."

"Go online, save the planet," Hori said.

"Exactly. Of course, if we're going to promote more regular Temple use as an ethical solution to climate change, we need to be proactive in providing the infrastructure."

Caleb jumped in again, and Martha was taken by surprise, but didn't fight to take the conversation back from him. "If we’re to remain players in the game, we think a step we can take is to start looking into real estate.”

“Real estate?”

“Think of it as transitional housing. If more and more of the population are interested in living most of their lives on the Temple platform, then we need to provide the infrastructure for that. A new form of housing. Living arrangements where people can stay online as much as they want, in a manner that doesn’t compromise their bodily health. Personal isolation tanks, providing perfect nutrition to every part of the body, muscle stimulation to prevent muscle atrophy, some regulation to keep people from atrophying. We hope to prove it’s possible for people to live most of their lives virtually in a way where they still maintain autonomy, they're still able to come and go as they see fit. We’ve looked at the numbers, and the upfront cost to us to make these facilities optimal will be a little steep, but totally affordable based on future projections. In the long term, why not see it as a win for the planet earth? In some metrics, if even just 30% of the population signed up to become members, tenants of these facilities, we could smash the goals for the Paris agreement. It could be a transitional model for how people can live, full lives, totally removed from some of the most major problems plaguing the planet. Honestly, if people can get over their matrix phobia, I think it could save humanity and heal the planet. And it’s a choice left to everyone.”

“But, _we_ wouldn’t want people to _not_ do this, right?” The question felt childish as soon as it escaped Hori’s nervous lips, but it was also the kind of piercing question children sometimes ask that fill adults with shame.

Caleb responded, “Obviously, our businesses interests will always be in more customers. But I think Uma was spot on before. To a large extent, this thing we’ve introduced to the world was inevitable, and now that it’s out there, it’s beyond our control. But I see no reason why our mission from this point can’t be entirely transparent, and I for one don’t feel an ounce of regret so far-- as long as we continue to be proactive in providing solutions.”

“Excuse me, I’m feeling a little faint, I need to hop off.” Hori pulled off his goggles and moved quickly to the bathroom, a wave of nausea twisting his insides. Uma quickly signed off, though more cordially, and met Hori in the bathroom.

“We were almost finished.” She ran the sink and wet a towel underneath it and then put it to his face. “You could’ve hung in a little longer.”

“I couldn’t,” he said weakly, his body pulsing with adrenaline and vertigo. He took the towel and wiped it across his face and sat on the toilet, back slouched, staring at the ground. Then he looked up at her. “How are you holding yourself together?”

“By keeping things in boxes,” She returned, leaning against the sink. “What’s going on in the world is a separate thing from what’s going on with Sophie.”

“Is it?”

“It must be. Or else I’d be like you, right now.”

“But, that’s a willing delusion.”

“A functional one. If I let reality just wash over me, I’d be as useless as you right now.”

Hori stood up and approached her with fists clenched.

“You think we had nothing to do with what happened to our daughter?”

“Of course we did. See? Your head still isn’t clear. Of course it wouldn’t have happened without us giving it to her. But just as easily, she could’ve been someone else’s child, and gone against her parent’s wishes, and the same thing would’ve happened.”

“Cool customer. That's what everyone always calls you. It’s a cold heart, is what it is.”

“You think I don’t care about her.”

“That’s how it seems to me now.”

“You know what I think is going to happen with Sophie, Hori? I think she’s going to end up in one of those graveyards Caleb was describing. I have no illusions about what that place he wants to build is: Packed like sardines, as many as they can fit in a space, all dreaming until they die. If Sophie hadn’t been the one, you would’ve sounded like Caleb and that Martha girl: freedom of choice, everyone deserves to live whatever kind of life they want, all that. But because she’s _your_ daughter, and you think you _own_ her, that all of the sudden life is more worth living. You know what kind of world she’s been growing up in? Terror after terror, horror after horror, with no end in sight. And unlike our parents, who just had to sit there and look at it and go dead inside, our children get to escape it. And God Bless them, why shouldn’t they? Why should they continue to be miserable in this place?”

“Do you hear yourself? How can you not hear yourself? You want to euthanize her! You want her to give up on herself!”

“You can’t hear my words anymore. All you see is a woman you hate. Stop talking to me, we’re not going to get through to each other. Go talk to her if you really want to find out. I already know her mind on this, don't expect to get what you want.”

Uma left the bathroom, went out to the back porch overlooking the ocean, and put on her goggles.

-------------------------------

Sophie was reading Edgar Allan Poe's, “_A Dream Within A Dream._” Over and over again, she read it, wondering why it started as a statement, and ended in a question. A knock came to her door, and she knew it was her father by the knock, and she whispered to come in. He smiled to her. “Some Poe?”

“Yup.” She closed the book and looked at her father. He walked over and sat on the edge of the bed.

“How’re you feeling?”

“Okay. Tired, I guess.”

“Funny, no matter how long you sleep, sometimes you still feel tired.”

“It’s called depression.” Hori was stunned, but then Sophie cracked a small smile. Hori & Sophie had always shared a flat, gallows humor together, and Hori had never been more grateful for it. He placed a hand on her shin and asked her, “What has made you so sad of late?”

“I don’t know.” She looked off through her window onto the ocean. “I think I’ve been sad for a long time.”

“I’m sorry it took me so long to figure out. I’m sorry, Sophie, that your mother and I have been so busy, and we assumed you were okay. You have nothing to blame yourself for, and we have so much to make up to you.”

“Thanks. I don’t think it matters now, though.

“I’m not expecting you to forgive us. All I ask is that you give us a chance to make it right.”

“Make what right?”

“Whatever it is that’s made you so sad, that’s made you want to not live this life.”

Sophie fell silent. Hori struggled with wanting to pull the words out of her, as gently as he could manage. “Please, Sophie, tell me how you really feel. I don’t want you to feel like you must lie to me.”

“I feel like you’re saying that, but you don’t really mean it.”

“What?”

“I feel like you want me to just be happy again, and just love this life and that’s it.”

“No, I won’t judge you. I will accept whatever you say, I promise.”

Sophie began, knowing if she were to get what she wanted, she would have to say it, no matter how true or false her father’s promise.

“When I was in the Temple, I was happy. For years, when I’ve been here in this world, it’s not been happy. I’m alone. I don’t have any real friends a lot of times, because most of the people I meet at school are awful. And you guys have always been trying to make me ready to do something big and great and important, but I’ve never wanted any of it. And, I don’t think the world’s going to get better, I think it’s going to get worse. I don’t think humanity will survive the end of the century. I don’t think I’ll meet someone I love, I don’t think anything good is going to happen here. So, I don’t want this world. I want to stay in the Temple. And I don’t see why I should have to stay here if I don’t want to.”

Hori panicked inside and hated that Uma might be right. Even in this moment, he wished he had his wife's willpower. At the same time, he also knew why his own approach had made for a much warmer and loving relationship with his daughter than Uma had ever managed. 

“I think that’s all very understandable. Of course, your mother and I have been trying to give you and everyone else the opportunity to that world. I’ve always reasoned it was a good thing. Of course, you can’t understand as a parent, but a protective instinct kicked in with me, a certain sentimentalism, I acknowledge that. All I want is for you to be happy, on whatever terms you decide your own happiness.” He paused, trying to pick words carefully, and each delayed moment only affirmed the feeling that he was about to say the opposite of what he just had, despite all his promises, and yet he must.

“All I want then, is to leave you with an idea. The debate about reality goes back thousands of years. Today, we still can’t prove we’re not in a simulation already. As time goes on, it will probably only appear more and more certain that there is no reality, and everything is only simulated. 

“You know Plato’s Allegory of the Cave? Men strapped to a wall, and all they’ve ever seen is shadows, until one of them breaks free, and they see the fire and the puppets, and they climb up out of the cave, and at first the light is too bright and they go back into the cave, but with time, they go and bring their fellows out of the darkness. Implicit in that tale is a belief that the truth is better than a lie, which might seem obvious, but still we must ask, why? In the unreal world, the men are bound by chains, so they're not free, they are slaves. So with the truth, comes freedom. That’s how it was said long ago.

“But, does that still hold up now? And are we so certain the allegory is correct? I doubt it myself. But, here’s my stance, one I think I forgot for a long time, and only with you falling asleep did I remember it: There is an objective world, called reality, something that is true, and it is bigger than you. You are a part of it, but not the whole of it.

“That dreamworld you were in, might’ve been without pain or suffering, but it was not life. It was death. That’s to say nothing about death, but it doesn’t take account for the value of life, the value that in my own experience, is undoubtedly there. In a private dreamworld, while you might do anything you dream and imagine, you are not free, you are enslaved, and small, so impossibly small. I know what’s real because of all the things that go against my wishes. Frustrating, yes, but real, and I know it’s real, because it’s far bigger than me. And that doesn’t make me or anyone insignificant--no, it makes each of us _bigger_, _connected_, a part of this thing which is, frankly, still a mystery.

“I agree with you and your mother, everyone has the right to pursue their happiness, in this world or any other world, contrived or otherwise. Sophie, all I ask of you is to stay here a little longer, see if you might not see the beauty of a world that is _far_ bigger than your dreams. I cannot promise it will be pleasant, in fact, you’re right, I’m most certain it won’t be--but it won’t be wholly unpleasant, either. You can still be surprised in this world, shocked and awed, stupefied into laughter that hurts your face. You can grow and learn lessons. You can understand consequences. You can know a beauty bigger than any fantasy, any dream. And it will be _real_.”

Hori ran out of breath, finally feeling the sleepless night wash over him. “I won’t force you to stay in this world. But I beg you, give reality a chance, for a little while longer. I promise it’ll be worth it. Or, I at least hope you’ll see what I see.” He reached out to give his daughter a hug, and she accepted it, even squeezed a little back. He started to pull himself up. “I know I promised you pesto pasta, and just went on and on about the virtues of reality, but to be honest, in this moment I could use a bit of dreaming myself.”

“You can sleep here, if you feel like it.” Hori smiled at Sophie. With a few adjustments, he lay next to her with a throw blanket draped over him, and Sophie popped open her book to read,

 “O God! can I not save

_One_ from the pitiless wave?

Is _all_ that we see or seem

But a dream within a dream?”

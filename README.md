# Summer Projects '21 Brainstorm

--Here I will develop a plan/Itinerary for which stories to work on, when, and keep note of each of their progress.

Stories 1st drafted:  KFC, Taru, Party, MAU, Cave, Space

Stories TBD: Maya, Evil Empire.

--Process: Draft all stories, then move to revision phase.

Goals: Get all stories into workshop.  Have drafts ready for peer review, on a rolling basis.

Some kind of schedule/timeline on which to get each story to nearest possible state of completion, in the course of the summer. With each story at its respective checkpoint, send it out for peer review. 

So what do I want to do next? I'll continue to learn how to use this format as I get used to it. I am redrafting Evil Empire, both of whic are stories I've written before that I'm interested in re-doing, just having the stories in my head. If it's easy for me to jump in with and egange and asee hwere it goes.

We've got a full three months, the whole summer, before classes start. I want to be able to walk into the school year with all these stories thoroughly revised, maybe already workshopped a bit, and arguably "done" and that right now feels very attainable. There's drafts of everything except Maya Saves New York. While I've technically done that one before, I'm completely reapproaching it. FOr this story, I want to transparently be myself as the narrator, and just tell the story. I think the fun hopefully will telling parts of the story concisely and more bird's eye view, and them zooming in on certain moments. I really don't even know what kind fo shape it's going to take ultimatley. Somethign very strongly in my own voice, with the license to do inventive thigns with narrative,  and I think I will keep time stamps throuhgout the day. Something Joyceian about the whole thing without trying to impersonate anyone's ways of speaking, cringe. Just speak as myself and tell the story. It'll be a very interesting experiment to jump into, i'm not sure at which point. 

ONce Maya has a pass, it's just about picking the next one to do a round of revisions on. I think I want to do Taru and the Mask, because I feel like I still need to make a first draft on the version I have in mind. 

6/8/21

So, I've decided I want to put Maya on the backburner for now, or maybe just take my time with it and be slower. I want to start getting into major revisions with some of the other stories. Perhaps starting with the ones that are closest to being done, which would probably be The Cave first, and that's what I should try and submit to Tom by Saturday or Sunday? Then I'd probably look at Taru, then KFC, then Imagi, then Space, Then party. Party is the furthest away I think. I trust a lot of the initial drafts of the other stories, they just need more structure, refinement, and a sense of "pop" as each thing demands. Taru & the Mask is something I will have to rebuild a little more, but I have a really strong Idea of what's going on. Nation of Imagi too is pretty much fine with me in essence, it's more about refinement, taking more time with the end which I rushed through a bit. Enjoy making this world I'm setting up deep and rich. But, it's basically what I want it to be in vision. Space between notes, the idea is there, but the execution is sloppy. That will take a bit more work. KFC I also think is there in vision, but again I think the ending is rushed and I do this thing where I just want to say the thing. But still, pretty close. Cave is also pretty close, it's the middle exposition-y part that's rushed, but this can be good for workshopping super soon. Then party is far off the mark and needs a lot of planning. It's the one that probably has the biggest idea. It's what I'd set up as the last one in this collection. So, goal for this weekend is to polish up The Cave and send it to Tom so that it we could put it in the pile for submission.

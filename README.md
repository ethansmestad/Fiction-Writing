# Summer Projects '21 Brainstorm

--Here I will develop a plan/Itinerary for which stories to work on, when, and keep note of each of their progress.

Stories 1st drafted:  KFC, Taru, Party, MAU, Cave, Space

Stories TBD: Maya, Evil Empire.

--Process: Draft all stories, then move to revision phase.

Goals: Get all stories into workshop.  Have drafts ready for peer review, on a rolling basis.

Some kind of schedule/timeline on which to get each story to nearest possible state of completion, in the course of the summer. With each story at its respective checkpoint, send it out for peer review. 

So what do I want to do next? I'll continue to learn how to use this format as I get used to it. I am redrafting Evil Empire, both of whic are stories I've written before that I'm interested in re-doing, just having the stories in my head. If it's easy for me to jump in with and egange and asee hwere it goes.

We've got a full three months, the whole summer, before classes start. I want to be able to walk into the school year with all these stories thoroughly revised, maybe already workshopped a bit, and arguably "done" and that right now feels very attainable. There's drafts of everything except Maya Saves New York. While I've technically done that one before, I'm completely reapproaching it. FOr this story, I want to transparently be myself as the narrator, and just tell the story. I think the fun hopefully will telling parts of the story concisely and more bird's eye view, and them zooming in on certain moments. I really don't even know what kind fo shape it's going to take ultimatley. Somethign very strongly in my own voice, with the license to do inventive thigns with narrative,  and I think I will keep time stamps throuhgout the day. Something Joyceian about the whole thing without trying to impersonate anyone's ways of speaking, cringe. Just speak as myself and tell the story. It'll be a very interesting experiment to jump into, i'm not sure at which point. 

ONce Maya has a pass, it's just about picking the next one to do a round of revisions on. I think I want to do Taru and the Mask, because I feel like I still need to make a first draft on the version I have in mind. 

6/8/21

So, I've decided I want to put Maya on the backburner for now, or maybe just take my time with it and be slower. I want to start getting into major revisions with some of the other stories. Perhaps starting with the ones that are closest to being done, which would probably be The Cave first, and that's what I should try and submit to Tom by Saturday or Sunday? Then I'd probably look at Taru, then KFC, then Imagi, then Space, Then party. Party is the furthest away I think. I trust a lot of the initial drafts of the other stories, they just need more structure, refinement, and a sense of "pop" as each thing demands. Taru & the Mask is something I will have to rebuild a little more, but I have a really strong Idea of what's going on. Nation of Imagi too is pretty much fine with me in essence, it's more about refinement, taking more time with the end which I rushed through a bit. Enjoy making this world I'm setting up deep and rich. But, it's basically what I want it to be in vision. Space between notes, the idea is there, but the execution is sloppy. That will take a bit more work. KFC I also think is there in vision, but again I think the ending is rushed and I do this thing where I just want to say the thing. But still, pretty close. Cave is also pretty close, it's the middle exposition-y part that's rushed, but this can be good for workshopping super soon. Then party is far off the mark and needs a lot of planning. It's the one that probably has the biggest idea. It's what I'd set up as the last one in this collection. So, goal for this weekend is to polish up The Cave and send it to Tom so that it we could put it in the pile for submission. 



6/22/21 I've made tremendous progress  on a lot of these stories, and I'm very proud of myself. In terms of what I have here, my immediate focus is Taru & The Mask. I think I might want to shift to some other stories after that might be a little easier. I also need to more regularly revisit drafts and see how I feel about them and if I have any other ideas. After Taru, I think I might want to do Chimera, or Singularity, or Improvising, because that one's really already in a written form and just needs to be fleshed out, allowed room to breathe. It's a fun fantasy story though, worth holding on to. The deadline I gave myself was beginning of august I'd submit a bunch of stories to friends and peers for feedback. But sending a bunch of stories means that it's going to take longer for everyone to get through it. So maybe I should go ahead and send what I have to give people time to look through it, and then keep working on stories, because I could shoot myself in the foot by dumping it on people all at once and then no one can respond. 

6/25/21 I've been hazing a rough time getting the ball rolling because of life things, but ultimately progress is good. Vic gave good notes on The Cave that can improve it. I haven't drafted Taru yet, and that feels like the biggest thing I want to accomplish. It is going to be a kind of story the represents a new lvel of thoroughness and rigor, And I think it'll be totally worth it, but it will be challenging. I'm also interested in  going back to another batch of sci fi and fantasy story, since those seem to have been getting traction. That'd be Chimera, Borders, Improvising, and these are partially more tempting because they feel like they'd be simpler. There's also singularity, an old story, but one of which I think there's still an essential nugget. Now that I'm reconciled to this being a story about grief. Because I think a central thing I want to achieve in this story is this scientific thesis \(it'll honestly be a littl ebit of wonky pseudo-science\) But I want to articulte my vision of what singularity can mean in a few different ways.

Recent events have made me consider in writing a few things: 1\) Authenticity, sincerity, vulnerability, can be felt by a reader. Writing and creating from such a place will alway shave more of an impact. I want to watch out for the fascination of ideas, the glitz and glamour of construciton, and keep in mind that what will make my stories slap the most is when I know the emotional core. I still haven't written something that is about my sense of grace-- I think rather i'd keep tha tin mind, in the background of all my stories. That heartbreaking tenderness, the suffering that comes form caring about something, but you wouldn't have any other way. I want to make sure that tenderness and heartbreak is in every story, a way of seeing that makes us ache with love.



6/28/21 -- Self check-in about where I'm at. Ultimately good place. Got pretty awesome and positive feedback on Alien Utopia, people were thoroughly entertained and had no toruble gettign through it and enjoying themselves. FOr the most part. There were people who I think didn't enjoy it's non-seriousness, or the style and tone, and some notes were helpful. I'll make an adjusted version and see what's up. I can see how there's an MFA perspective that gets harped on, a certain somber seriousness, and I like that I am presenting something fun. That being said, it seems hard to find an audience or publication that doesn't favor serious pieces about identity, because that it absolutely the culture right now, one I don't malign at all, it's just not something I can really speak to. It was interesting to hear these other writers talk about how much mental illness was the cushio of their work, and that's not somethign i relate to. Not that I need to relate and understand everything, but there are just some thigns that are not my place to speak to. Being specific, honing in on what my mind sees, is exactly what I should be doing. I think I need to embrace letting even short stories take more time, let them be really good. Because once they're done, it's like a forever thing, usually anyway. One thing at a time. I like the new singularity idea. I need to flesh that out, but it'll probably be a little more intimate and grounded than the original which was a little all-over the palce and grandiose in a way that was shallow. This new angle will be about specific people who we resonate with and imagining very interesting outcomes for them. I feel like I had some new thoughts about The Party too? I think as well, I wanted to take more time, be less fantastical, more grounded. I think it can still have a magical effect to it, especially as it reaches absurd heights, but I need to take more time to savor the intimate parts of parties, the ones people can actually relate to. The games, the intimate conversations, all the different kind of moments. It just means taking more time to figure all that out, think about all the different kind fo moments, how to sequence them, how to make it make sense for the main character, how to make sure he has agency in the situation, as someone who's the antithesis fo a party goer and somehow transforms into something else. Probably still not a party animal by the end, even if they've had the full experience over the course of the night. It's the kidn of party where you spend the whole night awake, and don't leave until people are already going about their day. I definitely want it to find its way into the spirit world where we understand ourselves to be part of an eternal celebration. It's basically a rip-off of Steppenwolf, but a little more tongue and cheek and less serious than hesse. & based on Vic's notes, and a few more notes  I need to get on the other stories there'll obviously be a revision. And The Cave needs to be expanded to include Sophie's decision to move in to one of these centers, the world unfolding, what do the parents do, in their loveless situation? and especially if their daughter is almost entirely out of their lives. I could see Hori making a deal with her, and wanting to take her to do all these nice thigns and entice her, but ultimately she's still oging to choose that. ANd of course it's not permanent at first. But there's also got tot be the possibility of the whole virtual space of people workign together. There's the choice of private universes or collective universes, and that's honestly probably something that opens this up into a whole big kit and kaboodle. But I need to at least get a short story out of it. I think there are good concepts here, and the seeds of some character arcs, and that's probably it, I just need to cement the character arcs more. I wonder what the KFC notes will be. I understand if people find it to be grotesque and unnecessarily disgusting. That is definitely part of my interest in this story, but perhaps there's a way to frame it better. I absolutely want this to be a story that indulges in disgust and things that offend people, for the point of questioning how we deal with acknowledging our connection to things we really hate and despise and want no part of. All the things we hate are a part of us. Soo this story feels important to me, but perhaps there's a different form of execution. 

Maya? Yeah, Maya should probably be the fall project. Once I get full first drafts on all my story prompts,  which includes Chimera, improvising, black saint and sinner lady. Those are the ones I want to include in this round of stories. After I have first passes of all that, I will move to do a first draft of Maya as a novella. Afterr we get a first draft of maya as a novella, then we pivot back to editing and submitting all these stories. And basically don't rest until all of them find a home published somewhere, because they're all fucking damn good. I can write great speculative fiction, science ficiton and fantasy, and I can write literary fiction. 



6/30/21 FIgured it out! It's definitely hard to get shit in gear when I'm working in the store, but that's no one's fault but my own. I can still find the focus. And what am I trying to focus on? Writing, but in lieu of that, more of the groundwork of a battle plan in terms of my career. There's the website to build and re-make, something that fits my style and aesthetic, once such a thing is established. Truly, the bottom line is getting work read and submitted. I should find a least a few suitable publications for each of the stories I'm working on. I could use some time of quiet and relax to just get away and spend time with the stories. Chimera, Singularity, Taru, The Party,

# Summer Projects '21 Brainstorm

--Here I will develop a plan/Itinerary for which stories to work on, when, and keep note of each of their progress.

Stories 1st drafted:  KFC, Taru, Party, MAU, Cave, Space

Stories TBD: Maya, Evil Empire.

--Process: Draft all stories, then move to revision phase.

Goals: Get all stories into workshop.  Have drafts ready for peer review, on a rolling basis.

Some kind of schedule/timeline on which to get each story to nearest possible state of completion, in the course of the summer. With each story at its respective checkpoint, send it out for peer review. 

So what do I want to do next? I'll continue to learn how to use this format as I get used to it. I am redrafting Evil Empire, both of whic are stories I've written before that I'm interested in re-doing, just having the stories in my head. If it's easy for me to jump in with and egange and asee hwere it goes.

We've got a full three months, the whole summer, before classes start. I want to be able to walk into the school year with all these stories thoroughly revised, maybe already workshopped a bit, and arguably "done" and that right now feels very attainable. There's drafts of everything except Maya Saves New York. While I've technically done that one before, I'm completely reapproaching it. FOr this story, I want to transparently be myself as the narrator, and just tell the story. I think the fun hopefully will telling parts of the story concisely and more bird's eye view, and them zooming in on certain moments. I really don't even know what kind fo shape it's going to take ultimatley. Somethign very strongly in my own voice, with the license to do inventive thigns with narrative,  and I think I will keep time stamps throuhgout the day. Something Joyceian about the whole thing without trying to impersonate anyone's ways of speaking, cringe. Just speak as myself and tell the story. It'll be a very interesting experiment to jump into, i'm not sure at which point. 

ONce Maya has a pass, it's just about picking the next one to do a round of revisions on. I think I want to do Taru and the Mask, because I feel like I still need to make a first draft on the version I have in mind.

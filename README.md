# Summer Projects '21 Brainstorm

--Here I will develop a plan/Itinerary for which stories to work on, when, and keep note of each of their progress.

Stories 1st drafted:  KFC, Taru, Party, MAU, Cave, Space

Stories TBD: Maya, Evil Empire.

--Process: Draft all stories, then move to revision phase.

Goals: Get all stories into workshop.  Have drafts ready for peer review, on a rolling basis.

Some kind of schedule/timeline on which to get each story to nearest possible state of completion, in the course of the summer. With each story at its respective checkpoint, send it out for peer review. 

So what do I want to do next? I'll continue to learn how to use this format as I get used to it. I am redrafting Evil Empire, both of whic are stories I've written before that I'm interested in re-doing, just having the stories in my head. If it's easy for me to jump in with and egange and asee hwere it goes.

We've got a full three months, the whole summer, before classes start. I want to be able to walk into the school year with all these stories thoroughly revised, maybe already workshopped a bit, and arguably "done" and that right now feels very attainable. There's drafts of everything except Maya Saves New York. While I've technically done that one before, I'm completely reapproaching it. FOr this story, I want to transparently be myself as the narrator, and just tell the story. I think the fun hopefully will telling parts of the story concisely and more bird's eye view, and them zooming in on certain moments. I really don't even know what kind fo shape it's going to take ultimatley. Somethign very strongly in my own voice, with the license to do inventive thigns with narrative,  and I think I will keep time stamps throuhgout the day. Something Joyceian about the whole thing without trying to impersonate anyone's ways of speaking, cringe. Just speak as myself and tell the story. It'll be a very interesting experiment to jump into, i'm not sure at which point. 

ONce Maya has a pass, it's just about picking the next one to do a round of revisions on. I think I want to do Taru and the Mask, because I feel like I still need to make a first draft on the version I have in mind. 

6/8/21

So, I've decided I want to put Maya on the backburner for now, or maybe just take my time with it and be slower. I want to start getting into major revisions with some of the other stories. Perhaps starting with the ones that are closest to being done, which would probably be The Cave first, and that's what I should try and submit to Tom by Saturday or Sunday? Then I'd probably look at Taru, then KFC, then Imagi, then Space, Then party. Party is the furthest away I think. I trust a lot of the initial drafts of the other stories, they just need more structure, refinement, and a sense of "pop" as each thing demands. Taru & the Mask is something I will have to rebuild a little more, but I have a really strong Idea of what's going on. Nation of Imagi too is pretty much fine with me in essence, it's more about refinement, taking more time with the end which I rushed through a bit. Enjoy making this world I'm setting up deep and rich. But, it's basically what I want it to be in vision. Space between notes, the idea is there, but the execution is sloppy. That will take a bit more work. KFC I also think is there in vision, but again I think the ending is rushed and I do this thing where I just want to say the thing. But still, pretty close. Cave is also pretty close, it's the middle exposition-y part that's rushed, but this can be good for workshopping super soon. Then party is far off the mark and needs a lot of planning. It's the one that probably has the biggest idea. It's what I'd set up as the last one in this collection. So, goal for this weekend is to polish up The Cave and send it to Tom so that it we could put it in the pile for submission. 



6/22/21 I've made tremendous progress  on a lot of these stories, and I'm very proud of myself. In terms of what I have here, my immediate focus is Taru & The Mask. I think I might want to shift to some other stories after that might be a little easier. I also need to more regularly revisit drafts and see how I feel about them and if I have any other ideas. After Taru, I think I might want to do Chimera, or Singularity, or Improvising, because that one's really already in a written form and just needs to be fleshed out, allowed room to breathe. It's a fun fantasy story though, worth holding on to. The deadline I gave myself was beginning of august I'd submit a bunch of stories to friends and peers for feedback. But sending a bunch of stories means that it's going to take longer for everyone to get through it. So maybe I should go ahead and send what I have to give people time to look through it, and then keep working on stories, because I could shoot myself in the foot by dumping it on people all at once and then no one can respond. 

6/25/21 I've been hazing a rough time getting the ball rolling because of life things, but ultimately progress is good. Vic gave good notes on The Cave that can improve it. I haven't drafted Taru yet, and that feels like the biggest thing I want to accomplish. It is going to be a kind of story the represents a new lvel of thoroughness and rigor, And I think it'll be totally worth it, but it will be challenging. I'm also interested in  going back to another batch of sci fi and fantasy story, since those seem to have been getting traction. That'd be Chimera, Borders, Improvising, and these are partially more tempting because they feel like they'd be simpler. There's also singularity, an old story, but one of which I think there's still an essential nugget. Now that I'm reconciled to this being a story about grief. Because I think a central thing I want to achieve in this story is this scientific thesis \(it'll honestly be a littl ebit of wonky pseudo-science\) But I want to articulte my vision of what singularity can mean in a few different ways.

Recent events have made me consider in writing a few things: 1\) Authenticity, sincerity, vulnerability, can be felt by a reader. Writing and creating from such a place will alway shave more of an impact. I want to watch out for the fascination of ideas, the glitz and glamour of construciton, and keep in mind that what will make my stories slap the most is when I know the emotional core. I still haven't written something that is about my sense of grace-- I think rather i'd keep tha tin mind, in the background of all my stories. That heartbreaking tenderness, the suffering that comes form caring about something, but you wouldn't have any other way. I want to make sure that tenderness and heartbreak is in every story, a way of seeing that makes us ache with love.

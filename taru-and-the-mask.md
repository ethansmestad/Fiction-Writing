# Taru & The Mask

5/18/21

Here I brainstorm what I want out of this generational narrative. I’m forming a pretty solid idea of what I want to go for across all my stories, but let’s just concern ourselves with what this one demands.

The thesis, simply stated:

1. Part of being young is looking up to your parents, and all your ancestors. The structure of a society that one lives in, with al the of idolatry dedicated to the golden legacy of the ancestors, and the world and peace they have given to us. This is where the story begins.
2. However it should come to pass, the secret is revealed: the ancestors are not what we thought they were. Their legacy is tarnished, evil. The immediate response to this crisis is rebellion, the youths wanting nothing to do anymore with the tradition they belong to, wanting to destroy the ancestors, wipe the slate clean.
3. In that war and confrontation, it must come to pass that the youth learns that the ancestors, first loved and then hated, _are_ themselves. The triumphs and the sins are all their to bear. It was always left to the next generation to stand judgement over the previous generation.
4. The young generation stands upon a precipice: They are facing challenges never before dealt with by any of their ancestors. They have learned that they are part of the chain of generations. It is only by assimilating and accepting the reality that the ancestors, everything they love and hate about where they came from, is totally within them to take forward and act upon.

So, this is all just a story structure, but not a story, and the question then becomes which is the most suited setting? The instinctive one that comes to my head is mythological, some ficitonalized early society with youths going through this struggle and this growth. At the same time, it feels important to me to put emphasis and focus on how this situation has actualized itself in our contemporary world, how it is continuing to do so.

 What might it look like in a contemporary setting? I see many stories, and i’m partially shy to choose the story of one family, one youth, because I don’t want to pretend it’s truly representative of the whole generational struggle.

 But, for example, I can well articulate the general beats of the millennial experience growing up in America, how the disillusionment took place, the trajectory, esp for the young white people of the country who are city-minded, rooted in a city culture, consider themselves progressives and leftists and whatnot. And _that’s_ maybe an interesting idea, that we treat this as a nested narrative, with the millennial looking for guidance in an obscure folktale that seems like a mashup of different cultures, so that they can read this story and seem to find a lot of truth echoing in it, and an ability to apply it to their own situation.

 Part of me wants to stretch the narrative limits, make it sweeping, able to touch on the many ways the situation is playing out today. And perhaps it can. But it does need the locus of characters, and it can perhaps be a few, it doesn’t have to be just one disillusioned millennial. Adults that still feel like children.

 That’s another interesting aspect of the specific generational battle: The way in which old, traditional metrics of adulthood have disappeared, creating not only delayed adolescence and a lingering sense of still benign a child even though we’re closer to 30, but overall the complete crisis over what to make of life, how to move forward, what to do.

 So the character can’t be too far off from me. At the end of your 20’s, still floating along without a significant partner, without a career path, a big nothing who has no idea what to become, is afraid to become anything.

 What’s also running through my head is how I want this to feel _vital_, to have a sense of immediacy, I want it to feel when someone’s reading it as if something very important is being said, like it contains the promise of something you need. I also want to be myself in my writing, and not shy about my own voice, and who I’m talking to. I’m talking to my generation, and I don’t need to be why about that. We’re all talking to each other, trying to figure out how to move forward, a way out of this darkness and confusion. So I’d like to keep that in mind. I almost feel like I just need to find the right point of entry, work my way there thinking through it, until I see the entry point of how I’m addressing the reader, who I’m talking to, to then tell them this story about someone just like them, who’s in the middle of this situation.

 That’s why My ALien Utopia worked so well, because the device of the narrative gelled so well with the substance of the story. So something like that would be beneficial here. What is my purpose in telling this story? It’s to provide a diagnosis for what we’re going through. Is there some way to treat this as a journal, to treat it as being close to home as possible, as true as possible? I like the idea of telling the myth, as a place where we get to see this diagnosis in plain sight, even if the reality of the character is a little more muddy.

 Why not just make it 1st person? If that’s what will give it the most immediacy, and hte most intimacy, the most vulnerability, to just really say how it’s been with me. And it’d be a similar set up to another story, where I need to share and talk about something that’s happened to me. That being, I’m caught up in my blunder of a life and very confused, when I happen upon this old myth in a book, and I read it and recount it, all while dealing with other situations, even a parallel situation. How am I walking away changed from this story that mirrors my own, about a youth taking charge of their authentic place in the march of generations? I think I know. We’d have to create something of a scenario regarding the narrators relation to the previous generation, the parents, with whom they have this disillusionment and have to step into this place of owning their place in history, coming fully into themselves and where they are.

 So I’m going to attempt this one in first person, just as someone who wants to speak to someone else just like me who’s been feeling this way. Might almost come across as a nonfiction essay, except it’s not. So I have an angle of entry here.

 Attempt 1 Frame concept: 1st person narrator, sharing a recent story of his floating, lost feeling in life, then describing the story he comes across, doesn’t read all at once. I could see the fallout with family having already happened, an open wound, but upon reading this story, the narrator goes to confront and deal with their family, assimilate it, whether it makes a difference to his family or not. Hell, maybe it’s just me with my dead parents and their invisible life of legacy. Not sure about this yet.

 Is there another angle of approach I might want to entertain? I thought I had another idea. The only other approach that might makes sense is to take on the 3rd person omniscient, and treat both stories as equally real, but I’m actually getting a lot more clarity over the first idea.

 Now is part of just refining or deciding more about this mythic story that’s discovered, because I’ll basically be inventing a myth from a fictional and obscure culture.

And perhaps at the end, I even reveal, or the narrator reveals that they made it up, but then how do you make sense of this story being of some benefit, some external boon that inspires an inner change in the narrator? I think we could still make sense of this, and this actually feels more vindicating, I think? Remember, the goal here is just to communicate and make sense of this larger issue the younger generations of today are dealing with, the questioning of the whole foundations of the traditions they belong to, and unmoored and unguided by the past, flailing about in violence to destroy all those things of the past. But yeah, this feels like something I could try tonight even, certainly this week.

5/20/21

Still thinking out loud here, because I want to not use 1st person just to convey an idea, but also to keep in mind a world of story, particularly character. Thinking about how much should just be freely borrowed from my own experience. Like I know the character is someone who’s dealing with this problem of disillusionment with their past. I think it makes sense to borrow from my own life and not hide behind anything. The most interesting thing in my case is the parents being dead, there’s no way I can reconcile in real life. And being dead, they remain on these pedestals in my head. I’m also hearing my north star tell me it needs to be a living family, so it can borrow from my life but it should be a unique situation.

----------

 5/21 -- Alright, still need to warm up a little bit. Trying to find my point of entry, to make this as good as possible, so I’m not just letting out a great fart, at least as I”m writing. I’m appraoching this from the vantage of the character who is going through this trial, maybe somethign like White Nights, where it’s a person’s perspective about this issue, but from a grounded place, because I don’t just want to make a thesis. But it’s like me trying to write a letter to the future, to future generations.

 This was supposed to be my graduate thesis, but it didn’t end up being that. I suppose it still is, but I didn’t even bother submitting it--in fact, I dropped out altogether, right at the finish line, because of the conclusion my research lead me to.

I was doing my research in recovery of older and forgotten, or perhaps purpofesully passed-over stories and myths, this one being dated to a group referenced by the egyptians and babylonians, often attributed to the lost city fo Atlantis. Most schools don’t take it seriously, investigation into Atlantis, because, well-- Atlantis is a myth with spotty archaelogical records at this point. But I wasn’t trying to claim Atlantis is real, and I’m still not. I was just investigating some old myths whose origins are still disputed, and for whatever reason, met with disinterest until now.

Before I even submitted any work for review, I already knew I could no longer go along the path I was going on. The reasons were entirely personal, and personal isn’t usually considered scholarly.

The personal stuff is exactly what I want to talk about, not just for me, but because I feel this lost myth, and this world we’re living in today--I think anyone in a position similar to mine might see what I mean when I get to it.

All I want to say in this preamble, is that I thought I’d be submitting a paper of research and analysis of an old forgotten myth of dubious origins, and that it’d put me on track to doctoral work and a career in academia. The result of my research, and I believe the implications of this myth, have caused me to strike out on a path which everyone--_everyone_--has advised me against. My family has disowned me over it. Yet, I’ve never felt so sure about anything in my life.

What I present below is the myth which I discovered, along with its bearing onto my own life. By the end, I hope the reader might understand my own actions and decisions, and that it might, in my brightest hopes, _liberate_ them to their own path.

 I remember where I was when someone told me Michael Jackson was a pedophile.

 I woke up one morning, in one of those moods where I felt like singing and dancing to start my day. _Rock With You_ is one of my favorites. I made breakfast and sidestepped and spun the whole time, ate my breakfast while my head waved back and forth. I got on the subway and danced to myself the whole way into work. Then when I got to work, and someone asked me how I was so happy at this time in the morning, I told them how Michael Jackson always puts me in a good mood. Then told me with dead eyes, “You know he’s a pedophile, right?”

 Of course I wanted to defend him, and of course I still do. When he died, I cried listening to the single they released after. I thought to myself, _All this man wanted to do was bring joy to the world, and that he did._ What more noble of a life could be lead than a life dedicated to spreading joy around the world, and who could say that he didn’t?

 But then I looked into it, and I had to face it. He wasn’t only what I thought he was. And of course everyone who loved him could talk about all the abuse he went through as a kid, his own childhood not being able to spend it being a kis, all these other kinds of sexual abuse. It didn’t matter, it didn’t change what he’d done to children. I think of Michael Jackson, because he’s one that hurts me a lot. But he was only the tip of the iceberg.

 I don’t need to give a list of names, because you knew them all and grew up with them too. And with each day, I wonder which other person I idolized and looked up to also hid dark secrets? I try to separate out what’s forgivable and what isn’t. It’s not always fruitful, since I’m trying to salvage something, what?

 The fact that everything I was raised to believe in has proven to be a lie. Almost everything. Enough to cast doubt on everything that hasn’t been proven a hoax yet, anyway.

 It was true with my family, too. But I’ll get around to that. For now, we’ve established that in today’s world, everything in the past that was sold to us as shiny and pure, transcendent, passed down through generations -- it was all a lie.

 And we’re supposed to do what with this? I’d been lead to believe for my most of my life that aspiring to measure up to that legacy of our parents, all the other people we admire form history, is the highest we could aspire to--but know, we want nothing but to run as far away as possible form that legacy--into what are we running? WE have no guidance, no model for our actions. And we are still children.

 It was at this juncture, that is, the juncture of despair where I cam upon a story in a strange old collection of myths. An ancient fairytale ascribed to Atlantean lore-- yes, ridiculous, for certain. The scholarly introduction stated that the tale had been adapted and readapted out of context through Greek and Latin, and versions of it popped up all around the mediterranean, even into Africa. BUt, accroding to this book, a few decades after Napoleon’s conquest in Egypte revived archaeology of the area, and earlier version of this story was found on heiroglyphic scrolls that dated it to 1500 BC.

 I’d never heard any version of it that sounded familiar before. It was about a boy named Taru, his father Todoton, and a magical mask with a life of its own. So the tale was called “Taru and the Mask.” I’ll reproduce it here, not just as an interesting piece of overlooked history, but as an old voice that feels familiar-- like your own echo returning to you millennials after you first spoke.

 TARU AND THE MASK

 Taru was the beautiful young son of the king, Todoton. Todoton was the king of Atlantis, and a benevolent steward of the Land of Lemuria, in the lands to the south.

 Todoton was known by all as the mightiest of warriors, the wisest of leaders, the most good-natured, and benevolent of all kings. His deeds were known far and wide, and told by the people on almost every occasion, including the seasonal festivals.

 In the winter, the people told tales of Todoton’s birth, and how the mages read the stars and foresaw that this son of the king Telleron would be a great king, a savior of the land, and all the kingdom celebrated his birth and arrival. In the fall, during the harvest, the people told each other the story of when Atlantis was attacked by Yorunda, the great winged serpent, who destroyed the city, plundered its riches, and took the princess Bellana captive. Todoton received the Mask, which had been with the people since the first King Patyron, given to him by the Gods. Wearing the mask, he dared through the treacherous swamps, sailed across the treacherous seas, fought through a storm of fire, and finally deep into the poisonous caves where Yorunda dwealt with his stolen treasures. There, King Telleron slayed Yorunda, retrieved princess Bellana, and returned to the city a hero.

 This was only the first of many chronicles of Todoton’s greatness. He fought the mad King of Lemuria in single combat, and ended the war between at Atlantis and Lemuria, and sailed the world to foreign and distant lands, winning friends, victories, and spoils. Many Atlanteans believed Todoton would not die a mortal death, but would at the appointed hour, be called up into the heavens to join the ranks of the Gods, and that this was the destiny of all the kings of Atlantis who lived up to the legacy of their fathers.

 Taru dreamed of nothing but to join his ancestors among the realm of the Gods, and spent every day of his youth training in swords and words, strategies of battles, wise words from the centuries of scribes and counselors on all matters of ruling, and consulted with the mages on their arts.

 In all this time, Taru had never seen his father’s face. It was custom, when the heir to the throne came of age, that he would wear the Mask, called Tanathon, which would make him King of Atlantis and all that the sun touched. Todoton would finish a meeting of the council, and passing his son, would say, “Soon, your time will come to wear the mask, and I will go to join our ancestors.”

 When the day finally arrived, Taru’s heart beat mightily in his chest, and his father, Todoton, came to tell him it was time.

 They went deep beneath the palace, into sacred chambers no one else but the rulers of Atlantis ever entered. The ceremony was conducted in the dark, because when the mask was passed from one ruler to the next, the successor must never see his father’s face.

 Taru, overcome with curiosity, looked as his father took the mask from his face, and what he saw shocked him.

 His father’s face was ugly and evil. It told of horrible things, and as if his whole face was a confession, he saw that his father’s life was not what everyone has been lead to believe. In his face, he saw what happened the day Todoton went through the same ritual with his father: how Todoton saw the same evil and ugliness, and murdered his father right there in the secret chamber, as his father had done before. He saw that Todoton had sought out Yorandur himself, and promised he would not stop the serpent from seiging the city, knowing that to take revenge would bring him glory. He saw that on his journey toward the monster’s lair, he slew many innocents, used his people as playthings and puppets. He saw that he did not fight Yorandur bravely, but poisoned the beast in its sleep. He saw that Bellana, Taru’s mother, had been taken by force, that her whole life at Todoton’s side was as much a prison and capture as Yorandur’s lair had supposedly been.

 Faint of heart, Taru fell to the floor, crawling away from his father. Todoton spoke: “Now you see, Taru, the place of all the kings and the ancestors. When we allow the magic of Tanathon over us, we do what we must for Atlantis to live.”

 “I am reviled by the sight of you, father,” Taru cried, “and I want to end you with everything within me.”

 “As you must,” Todoton returned solemnly, through his grimacing face. “As I have done to my father, and his before him. This is the way that Atlantis stays peaceful and prosperous.”

 “I would rather die myself than become what you have become,” Taru cried.

 “In a sense, you will die when you are crowned by Tanathos. If you do not, then all the kingdom will fall, and all will be for nought, ruin, and doom endless and for all time.”

 In despair, Taru fled the ancient chamber, out the palace, hiding through the streets of his people and out beyond the walls, until he found the quiet of the wood.

 In solitude, Taru paced the grove and contemplated his situation. “Oh, my father,” he cried, “All my happiness was rested upon a falsehood. All the good rested upon an evil. Is there no good in this world that does not have an evil at its root?”

 “I will stop this evil. I will go to the people, and I will give them truth!” And without a further thought, Taru returned to city, greeted by people who knew him as prince, and followed him as he lead them to the place form which the ruler speaks to the people.

 From that place, he told them the truth of the rulers: the evil, the lies that supported every good. Having told the people the truth of their rulers, they fell into despair just as he had. Brother turned against brother. With no noble thign to believe in, they fell into evil ways, seeing no reason not to, and before his eyes, the city fell apart. Todoton emerged from the chamber to see Atlantis in turmoil, still wearing Todoton, and cried, “O, my son, you have ended everything! For your insolence, there shall be no more future, but only doom!” And with that, Todoton slew himself. Amidst the havoc, Taru took the mask from his father’s face and once more fled the city.

 Out in the wilds, he once more cursed the mask, saying to it, “It is you! You who have ended everything! You came from the Gods to make slaves of its kings, to condemn them to evil lives, and because I would not play your game, you have ruined everything!”

 Then, Tanathos, the mask, spoke with a voice made of thousands.

 “Taru, you do not yet see the truth of things. Place me over your face, see through my eyes, see all that I have seen, then you will know.”

 Taru wanted in that instant to disobey, destroy the mask once and for all, but curiosity came over him, and he placed Tanathos over his own face.

 Through Tanathos’s eyes, he looked into the face of the first of his line, Gondell. Then, he saw through Gondell’s eyes, as he slew the chieftain, and proclaimed this is where Atlantis would be built. He heard Gondell’s contemplations on the prosperity Tanathos promised him would come, and the prices that would be paid. Many men he enslaved to build his city, and many men died before the city was done. Generations of men who had began as his brothers, over the time, their children only knew themselves to be slaves, he the master, his son the next master. And the time came when the city needed more supplies, and he set out with warriors and took from many innocents. And the task was passedon to his son, telemon, and when Gondell took off the mask, his son saw his ugliness and slew him, ashamed. The mask now went onto Telemon’s face, who carried the shame, and continued the work.

 Taru watched the many, many lives of his ancestors, lived them as his own, and saw the sins of the father visited upon the children, and each time, the children fought to repent for the father, to pay the debt to their people, to improve things, and every time a price was paid. After several generations, it was understood that is was the mask, Tanathos, that held Atlantis together, and held the chain of generations, that this was the price of all kings, the way it was for the Son of Atlantis, so long as there would be an Atlantis

 Taru realized that all his life when he thought of the Ancestors, he thought only of the glory of Tanathos, the mask, the idol that promised greatness. Seeing through his ancestor’s eyes, the difference between him and then had disappeared. One spirit moved from generation to generation. All his ancestors lived on in him now. All their victories and glories, and all of their crimes and regrets, their hopes that a son might come one day to redeem them, to give them a second chance, to fix their mistakes, to repent, wash clean their sins. Taru was all the kings, everyone who he’d ever been taught to live up to, now reduced to children just like himself, caught in a trap. One person, repeating a life over and over, hoping to make things better the next time around.

 Taru ripped Tanathos from his face, knowing perfectly well who he was, and shattered the mask upon a rock.

 This is where the myth ends. There are most likely other fragments yet to be discovered. That’s my hope, anyway, but perhaps a foolish one. After all, the world didn’t end--Atlantis did, maybe but not the world.

 Yes, it’s just a myth, not something to be read as history, and yet I can’t help but see all of history in this myth. I see a story of generations, so many generations they’re impossible to count, and with whatever deviations, so many striking redundancies from one generation to the next. It’s called tradition. Of which there are also countless traditions. Not many have been perfectly preserved through history, if any, but to deny the fact of traditions is to deny the very landscape of our present realities.

 This story we’re living now, this modern world and its dazzling, unprecedented complexity, all has its foundation in a situation like Taru’s. I think now more than ever.

 Every story we were taught to trust and believe in, every idol, has turned out to be false. Not a one has been beyond scrutiny.

 My father was an influential man. I was a decent student, but his connections got me into the program. He was a professor, with published books, who gave talks around the country, and even received a medal from the president.

 By the time I was in high school, rumors were starting to float around him. The rumors were bad enough that my mother left him. I didn’t believe the rumors, so I decided to stay with him, and I know it meant a lot to him. My other sister and brother, the older ones, went with mom. It tore my family apart. My loyalty meant everything to him.

 When I went to college, there were more rumors. Before, I told myself that even if he did do something, it was a mistake, and not one he’d repeat again, because I believed he was a smart and ultimately good man. Students rallied to his defense, and spoke about how his classes changed their lives. I glanced over the stories of students who said he’d ruined them.

 I’ve been living by my father’s side, even as his career has fallen into complete disgrace. His allies thinned quickly over the four years of college, and he began to only sustain himself as a reactionary, someone who fought against cancel culture and PC policing of speech. I watched a man who taught with passion teach more and more with vitriol, anger, and malice disguised as rebellion. Even until most recently, when I told him about my studies and my research, he was proud of me for looking into the forgotten history, the parts of the human story everyone wanted to overlook. He’d started to style himself as a truthteller and martyr against the grain of the establishment. It was only after discovering this myth that something clicked within me.

 And I should start by telling the truth: the reason I can’t present this as a thesis is because I invented it. There’s not a shred of evidence to this myth because I made it up.

 But I’m sharing it with the world, and mainly, sharing it with my father, and my brothers and sisters, to tell them where I stand in the story of generations:

 We have every right, as the new generation, to judge our ancestors, and the world they’ve made for us--but we can’t do so without also admitting the truth that we _are_ our ancestors. That means we have no one to measure up to, no one to compare ourselves to. All our heroes, and out villains, live within us. They say we should learn from history, and that’s the hope of every generation. But we stand in a world that is the karma of all of our own previous actions, all the mistakes, all the outright and intentional evil, even all the good intentions. I don’t think we’re doomed to repeat their mistakes, but we also can’t hope to move forward into uncharted waters, facing problems that none of our preferred ancestors have ever had to face.

 We stand alone, the sum total of all our ancestors, and we have all the power we ever dreamed they have, and all the hang ups and traumas to work through. I take solace in knowing that I have all of the faculties I’ve admired in anyone in our common heritage, and as regards their faults, it’s for me and us all to remedy them how we can.

 I sense the evolution in the air. I sense the way in which, when we know our roots, we learn how we might branch out.

 I’ve come to feel grounded in myself for the first time in my life. I’m not living anymore in the shadow of my father’s greatness, nor his crimes. As I move forward in my own life, my only goal is to consider what my actions will mean for my, our descendants,s seven generations beyond my own. Today, I am building their world for them, and I can’t assure that we’ll succeed. But I know at that very least, we owe them a chance. Over and over again, we owe ourselves a chance.

 I want to keep in mind that while the legacy is a tarnished lie, a depraved fable, I want ot keep in mind that it’s a mixed bag, because all these lies have kept the kingdom prosperous, and to unearth it all threatens to bring down the kingdom and destory everything.

 Where I think I want Taru to end up is in the assimilation. Because it’s coming form finding out everything about your life and everything you were told to work up to was based in something horrible and evil, and you’re being told you have to live out the traditions, because if you don’t, then the whole world will end, basically. His reaction should be revolution, to try and go into the city and tell people the truth, and of course what happens from it is chaos and death. It could end just like that in a tragedy, but I want there to be a suggestion of another path. That he might somehow encounter the ancestors, and live through all of them. Ahh, I see.

 Nice! Okay, so muddy first run, but I actually think it does an admirable job of laying out the foundation. A few things I know Immediately:

--I want to intersperse the personal narrative throughout the myth, build both parallel stories to mutual points of climax. Which means I’ll be fleshing out and going into more showing of the student’s story.

--the structure of the myth is sloppy because it’s entirely improvised, but I actually think it does a decent job in essence of telling what needs to be told, being magical and such, but I missed the whole spiel about how the mask represents this one spirit that is the true face behind the mask of each individual generation. Maybe there’s a nice touch I can have about how the mask also holds the faces of the future generations yet to come. If it did, it would change the story, there may not be a breaking of the mask.

--I think this story does a good enough job of being the investigation into the past, without trying to predict a future. Because that can’t be done. All we can do is arrive at a place of authenticity. I also like this academic angle, that the narrator belongs to this ivy league academic family and the father is embroiled in scandal, I think this will be good once it’s made more of real people and such kinds of struggles.

--It’s also hitting home I think the present dilemma of our generation becoming aware of the scourge of history and coming to terms with their relationship to it, their place in history, that growing sense of the duty to give a chance to the next generation

Fuck yeah, Ethan Good shit!
